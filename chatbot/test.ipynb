We therefore, at the outset set out\\n\\nthe text of the judgment and order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       &quot;It seems that the High Court has not considered the various documents\\n\\non record suggesting factually the residence of Sharmila Biswas - respondent No.\\n\\n8 nor has it considered the admission of respondent No. 8. In our view, it will be\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                           1</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           2</span>\\n\\n\\nbetter if the matter is remitted to the High Court for reconsideration. Accordingly,\\n\\nwe set-aside the impugned order and remit the matter to the High Court for a\\n\\ndecision afresh after considering the various documents on record. Needless to\\n\\nmention here, the parties are at liberty to file fresh documents before the High\\n\\nCourt in support of their claim.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      The High Court will do well to dispose of the matter within six months from\\n\\nthe date of communication of the order.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      The appeals are allowed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.&quot;\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">      In order to appreciate this matter we need to set out the short fact giving\\n\\nrise to the appeal:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      The appellant and one Sharmila Biswas both applied for being appointed\\n\\nDealership of Liquid Petroleum Gases (in short LPG) for the area at Agarpara,\\n\\nsituates in the district of 24 Parganas (North). The respondent, Indian Oil\\n\\nCorporation Ltd., issued advertisement for the above purpose on 22nd December\\n\\n1997 inviting applications from eligible candidates. Pursuant thereto, selection\\n\\nprocess was initiated however the same was cancelled then. Subsequently, on 6th\\n\\nDecember 2000 they issued fresh advertisement in two newspapers one in\\n\\nEnglish Statesman and another in Ananda Bazar Patrika (Begali vernacular) for\\n\\nthe same purpose inviting applications from unreserved category for different\\n\\nplaces including Agarpara. In both the advertisements eligibility criteria was\\n\\nmentioned, that the residents of more than one districts may apply and other\\n\\nthings being equal, preference would be given to the resident of revenue district\\n\\nfor which distributorship was advertised. Both the parties above applied in\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                          2</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                          3</span>\\n\\n\\nresponse to the said advertisements and appeared in the interview held by the\\n\\nSelection Committee. The Selection Committee thereafter selected three suitable\\n\\ncandidates in which respondent No. 8, Sharmila, became the first candidate and\\n\\nappellant, Sibsankar, became the second. Hence, Corporation- respondent issued\\n\\nletter of intent for obtaining dealership in favour of Sharmila. However,\\n\\nSibsankar, appellant before us, challenged the said selection process by filing a\\n\\nWrit Petition being No. 1475 (W) of 2001 claiming himself the resident of\\n\\nconcerned 24 Parganas (North) prayed for cancellation of the selection of\\n\\nSharmila as she being non-resident of 24 Parganas North is disqualified. In the\\n\\nmean time Government of India, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas took\\n\\ndecision on 9th August 2002 for which the said Letter of Intent, issued in her\\n\\nfavour was cancelled. However, the said policy decision of the Central\\n\\nGovernment had been set aside by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and naturally\\n\\nLetter of Intent issued in favour of Sharmila was restored.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      Subsequently on receipt of the complaint the respondent Corporation\\n\\nmake enquiry with regard to the residential status of Sharmila. Thereafter a\\n\\nnotice dated April 20, 2004 was issued to show cause as to why the said letter of\\n\\nintent would not be cancelled. After considering the cause shown by Sharmila to\\n\\nthe said notice and giving opportunity of being heard the above Letter of Intent\\n\\nwas cancelled and it was concluded by respondent Corporation that Sharmila\\n\\nwas not the resident of 24 Parganas (North) revenue district. Sharmila thereafter\\n\\nfiled a Writ Petition being No. 20355 (W) of 2004 challenging the said order of\\n\\ncancellation of Letter of Intent.    Therefore, both the writ petitions involved\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         3</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                        4</span>\\n\\n\\nidentical issue, as such the learned Single Judge of this Court heard out the\\n\\nsame and were disposed of by a common judgment dated 10th December 2007.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     The Writ petition filed by appellant (WP No. 1417 (W) of 2001) was\\n\\ndismissed and writ petition filed by the respondent No. 8 was allowed,\\n\\nconsequently order of cancellation of Letter of Intent by respondent Corporation\\n\\nwas set aside and quashed. By the judgment and order impugned the\\n\\nCorporation was directed to appoint Sharmila as LPG dealer, for the area of\\n\\nAgarpara subject to fulfillment of other conditions mentioned in the Letter of\\n\\nIntent. The appellant before us thereafter challenging the said judgment and\\n\\norder of the learned Single Judge filed intra-Court appeal under Letters Patent\\n\\nunsuccessfully, as the Division Bench by Judgment and order dated 4th June\\n\\n2008 dismissed the appeal by holding that the decision of the learned Single\\n\\nJudge was not erroneous and did not call for any interference. Thereafter the\\n\\nappellant before us took this matter to the Apex Court by filing a Special Leave\\n\\nPetition being Nos. 23252 and 23259 of 2008 on which the above quoted\\n\\njudgment was rendered.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     On receipt of communication of the matter, it appears from the records, the\\n\\nDivision Bench of this Court presided over by Their Lordships the Hon&#x27;ble Mr.\\n\\nJustice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and the Hon&#x27;ble Dr. Justice Sambuddha\\n\\nChakrabarti were pleased to pass an order to hear out the matter. By order dated\\n\\n16th December, 2010, Their Lordships directed the parties to file affidavit in\\n\\nsupport of their respective claims and such affidavits were supposed to be filed\\n\\nby the reopening date in the month of January 2011. Then on the reopening\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                       4</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          5</span>\\n\\n\\nafter christmas vacation in the month of January 2011 noticing non-appearance\\n\\nof the appellant the Court directed the learned Lawyer for the respondent\\n\\nCorporation to serve notice upon the learned Advocate-on-record of the appellant\\n\\nintimating about the factum of the matter being called on and fixation of date of\\n\\nhearing thereafter. Accordingly the matter was adjourned for a week.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      It would appear from the direction of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\\n\\nfundamental issue for consideration basing on material placed earlier and fresh\\n\\ncollection, is whether residence of the respondent No.8 situate at 9/6, Rajendra\\n\\nRay Lane, Calcutta 700 036 falls within the revenue district of 24 Parganas\\n\\n(North) or not, and further to decide the matter afresh.\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">      The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court observed various documents were not\\n\\nconsidered nor admission as to the place of residence of the respondent No. 8\\n\\nwas considered.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      Hence, by several orders this Court on fresh hearing gave opportunities to\\n\\nfile necessary documents in support of their respective cases. In course of\\n\\nhearing the Court found there are documents and counter-documents in support\\n\\nof the respective cases really confused the Court so much so decision on the\\n\\nabove issue was not possible. As such in order to have the clear official position\\n\\nas to location and situation of the residence of the respondent No. 8, this Court\\n\\ndirected the District Magistrate and Collector to submit report with documents to\\n\\nthe effect whether the aforesaid place of residence of respondent No. 8 falls\\n\\nwithin the revenue jurisdiction or not. First order was passed on 13th April 2011\\n\\nand the said report was furnished by D.M. suggesting that the residence of the\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         5</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                          6</span>\\n\\n\\nrespondent No. 8 does not situate within the revenue jurisdiction of 24\\n\\nParaganas (North). On exception being taken by the respondent No. 8 the Court\\n\\nhad to pass another order on 28th June 2011 asking the District Magistrate to\\n\\ninquire into the matter personally calling for the records and to verify the same\\n\\nand submit a fresh report in sealed cover to the Court. The said order dated 28th\\n\\nJune 2011 was passed on the application made by Respondent No. 8 as it was\\n\\nfound the report submitted by the District Magistrate earlier was not in terms of\\n\\nthe order passed by the Court. It was found by the Court that District Magistrate\\n\\nrelied on a report submitted by an Officer below the rank of Additional District\\n\\nMagistrate moreover the materials relied on by the officials as well as District\\n\\nMagistrate were not sufficient to conclude the location of residence legally of the\\n\\nrespondent No. 8 in terms of order dated 28th June 2011. The District Magistrate\\n\\nsubmitted fresh report with all materials, documents and data and reported that\\n\\nthe residence of the respondent No. 8 does fall within the revenue district of 24\\n\\nParaganas (North). The second report was again challenged by the respondent\\n\\nNo. 8. This application as well as the appeal was heard simultaneously. In course\\n\\nof hearing on 2nd August 2011 the learned Senior Counsel Mr. P.K. Das\\n\\nappearing for the respondent No. 8 wanted to produce Election Identity Card of\\n\\nthe appellant and also the concerned Electoral Roll of the concerned\\n\\nConstituency where he resides. He emphasized that these two documents are\\n\\nnecessary in order to find whether the appellant himself is the resident of 24\\n\\nParganas(North) or not?\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                         6</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          7</span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">      At that stage we thought that the request of Mr. Das for production of the\\n\\ndocuments relating to Electoral Identity Card and Electoral Roll of the\\n\\nconstituency, to establish appellant&#x27;s place of residence was not required to be\\n\\naccepted. Later on it might be considered.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">      In the aforesaid narration of fact and sequence of events the learned\\n\\nCounsel Mr. Kaji Safiullah appearing in support of the appeal submits that the\\n\\ndocuments which are in the record before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court namely\\n\\nthe Show Cause Notice dated 26th April 2004 and further affidavit of respondent\\n\\nCorporation filed in the Writ Petition of his client would show that the respondent\\n\\nNo. 8 is not the resident of 24 Parganas (North) . Even it has been admitted by\\n\\nthe respondent No. 8 in her application for LPG Dealership and her reply dated\\n\\n4th May 2004 to the show cause notice dated 26th April 2004, supplementary\\n\\naffidavit filed by the respondent No. 8 in her Writ Petition No. 20315 (W) of 2004\\n\\nand further the admission before the learned Trial Court during the argument of\\n\\nher Writ Petition conclusively established that she is not the resident of 24\\n\\nParganas (North) and as such she is not entitled to the dealership for Agarpara\\n\\nsituated within the said district. She is disentitled because she could not comply\\n\\nwith the eligibility criteria as mentioned in the said advertisement in newspapers.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">      His next contention is that decision of Indian Oil Corporation which is the\\n\\ncompetent authority in this regard is the factor as they understand best about\\n\\nmeaning and topography of revenue district. By their investigation they found\\n\\nthat the respondent No. 8 is not the resident of 24 Parganas(North). In their\\n\\naffidavit supplementary affidavit before the Supreme Court in an SLP in\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                         7</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                         8</span>\\n\\n\\nconnection with WP 4175 they have specifically stated that the respondent No. 8\\n\\nis not eligible for LPG distributorship for Agarpara as she is not resident of 24\\n\\nParaganas(North) revenue district. The location of residence of his client is not\\n\\nthe germane in the matter therefore, argument challenging his residential\\n\\naddress is totally misplaced in this case. He further submits that the respondent\\n\\nNo.8 is the resident of Kolkata area not of the district 24 Parganas(North) as she\\n\\nhas been paying her property tax to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Lastly\\n\\nthe reports submitted by the Additional District Magistrate and District Land and\\n\\nLand Reforms Officer and thereafter the report of the District Magistrate show\\n\\nthat the said residence of respondent No. 8 does not fall within the revenue\\n\\ndistrict of 24 Parganas(North). The said reports are conclusive proof as to the\\n\\nresidential location of the respondent No. 8. Hence going by the norms of\\n\\npreferential treatment as published by the IOC his client being the second\\n\\ncandidate and being the resident of the local area is an automatic choice.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">      Mr. P.K. Das learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent No. 8\\n\\nsubmits that the residence of the respondent No. 8 falls within the revenue\\n\\ndistrict of 24 Parganas( North) . He has shown us the document namely\\n\\ncertificate of Commissioner of Police. Moreover the permanent address of the\\n\\nresident of respondent No. 8 will appear from her Voter&#x27;s Identity Card and other\\n\\ndocuments, thereby it is    proved that residence of the    respondent No.8 falls\\n\\nunder the revenue district of 24 Parganas (North) . He categorically refutes that\\n\\nthere has been any admission that she is not resident of 24 Parganas (North).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                        8</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                         9</span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">      He emphasized that report submitted by the Additional Land and Land\\n\\nReforms Officer and of District Magistrate are not    relevant   to determine the\\n\\nquestion of location of his client&#x27;s residence, as Voter&#x27;s Identity Card and\\n\\nElectoral Roll prove that the said residence is within the revenue district of 24\\n\\nParganas (North). He further submits that the payment of property tax to the\\n\\nKMC is not determinative factor as it is not a payment of tax to the Government\\n\\nRevenue by the respondent. The Municipal Corporation is a statutory          self-\\n\\ngoverning body and it cannot be termed to be as revenue authority of the State.\\n\\nHe further submits in any event the appellant is not the resident of 24 Paraganas\\n\\nNorth so he cannot question the appointment of respondent No. 8 nor can he\\n\\nclaim his appointment in place of respondent No. 8. He submits it would appear\\n\\nfrom various documents namely Electoral Rolls that the appellant himself is the\\n\\nresident of KMC nor of 24 Paraganas(North) . That apart he submits on the\\n\\nquestion of the balance of convenience that the respondent No. 8 had invested\\n\\nsubstantial amount of Rs. 50,00,000/- for this dealership with complete\\n\\ninfrastructure. He has been carrying on business at the said address for more\\n\\nthan last three years. This fact itself is an equity and the letter of appointment\\n\\nshould not be disturbed. To support this submission he placed reliance on the\\n\\nSupreme Court decision reported in (2010) 9 SCC cited on behalf of IOC.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      He contends further that at no point of time the appellant raised any\\n\\nobjection when the selection process was conducted and even after having\\n\\nparticipated and being declared unsuccessful the appellant has never challenged\\n\\nthe said appointment.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                        9</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                         10</span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">      He submits placing Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary page 680, Oxford English\\n\\nDictionary page 1223 and Encyclopedic Law Dictionary of Biswas at page 1267\\n\\nthat definition of resident is that of a permanency of the place of residence. The\\n\\nappellant&#x27;s permanent residence is either Belgachia or Kashipur as appeared in\\n\\nthe Electoral Roll. He himself is not the permanent resident of                24\\n\\nParganas(North) .\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">      Ms. Beenita Mehara, learned Counsel appearing for the respondent\\n\\nCorporation submits that Indian Oil Corporation issued letter of intent initially,\\n\\nhowever on receipt of complaint It investigated and found that the place of\\n\\nresidence of the respondent No. 8 was not situated within the revenue district of\\n\\n24 Parganas (North), hence It cancelled the letter of intent issued in favour of\\n\\nSharmila. In pursuance of the order of this Hon&#x27;ble Court Indian Oil Corporation\\n\\nrestored the letter of intent in favour of respondent No. 8 who had been running\\n\\nretail outlet since March 2008.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      In this connection the Corporation in the year 2000 modified its policy in\\n\\nthe manner if 1st empanelled candidate is cancelled for not fulfilling conditions\\n\\nand/or criteria, 2nd empanelled candidate would be appointed on satisfaction of\\n\\ncondition, if not, then 3rd empanelled candidate would be appointed subject to\\n\\nfulfillment of conditions. If the 3rd empanelled candidate fails to satisfy the\\n\\ncondition fresh selection process has to be initiated.    The policy of the said\\n\\nCorporation was modified as policy under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural\\n\\nGas has been done away with. She submits that she leaves this matter to this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                        10</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                          11</span>\\n\\n\\nHon&#x27;ble Court and whatever decision will be taken by the Court that will be\\n\\nrespectfully obeyed.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      After considering the submission of the learned Counsels and the material\\n\\nplaced before us the task of the Court is to find out firstly residential location of\\n\\nthe respondent No.8 in terms of the direction of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">      To speak precisely the scope of enquiry is whether the premises No. 9/6\\n\\nRajendra Roychowdhury Lane, Kolkata 700 036, being the declared residence of\\n\\nthe respondent No.8 is situated within the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas\\n\\n(North) based on the materials which had been filed earlier both in this Court\\n\\nand the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and further subsequently filed in course of fresh\\n\\nhearing before this Court. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court noted the contention of\\n\\nthe appellant before us that Sharmila is said to have admitted in pleading, that\\n\\nshe does not    have residence within the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Paraganas\\n\\n(North). The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court allowed the parties to file fresh documents if\\n\\nso advised. We have already noted that in order to decide this question of fact we\\n\\ncollected materials from independent sources. After having considered the\\n\\nmaterials placed before us we thought it fit those are not clinching factor to\\n\\ndecide this issue. Therefore, the respondent No. 8 has placed the following\\n\\ndocument in support of her case that the aforesaid place of her residence situates\\n\\nwithin the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North):\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      (a) Certificate of Commissioner of Police.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      (b) Revenue note under Clause 23(e).\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                         11</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                         12</span>\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     (c) Document recording District sub-Registry Office of Kashipore, Dum\\n\\n        Dum area is the Registration Office.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     (d) Document relating to Treasury Office of this area.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     (e) Document showing registration of Stamp Revenue by Kashipore Police\\n\\n        Station.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">     (f) The place of collection of Sales Tax, VAT of this area\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">     (g) Enrollment Certificate of Professional Tax of Respondent No. 8.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     (h) Kashipore Postal Office Certificate about the residential place of the\\n\\n        respondent No. 8 suggesting location of the residence of the respondent\\n\\n        No. 8 situates within the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Paraganas (North)\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     (i) Motor Vehicles Tax paid at Barrakpore, North 24 Paraganas.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     (j) Report of Deputy Commissioner as to revenue jurisdiction of the\\n\\n        residence of the respondent No. 8.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     (k) Information or intimation given by Deputy Secretary, Revenue (Finance)\\n\\n        Department Government of West Bengal.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     (l) Certificate that Kashipore Police Station has fallen within the revenue\\n\\n        jurisdiction of 24 Paraganas (North).\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">     As against the aforesaid documents the appellant before us has relied on\\n\\nthe following documents:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     (a) Admission of Sharmila.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">     (b) Certificate issued by Additional Director, Survey, West Bengal ex-officio\\n\\n        Joint Secretary, Government of West Bengal.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                        12</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                          13</span>\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      (c) Report of the office of the Director of Land Records and Surveys and\\n\\n         Joint Land Reforms Commissioner, West Bengal.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">      The registered conveyance has also been annexed by the Respondent No. 8\\n\\nto substantiate that the said properties situate within revenue jurisdiction of 24\\n\\nParganas (North). This conveyance was registered not in the District Registry\\n\\nOffice of the then undivided 24 Parganas but it was registered in the city of\\n\\nKolkata in the office of Registrar of Assurance. The description of the schedule of\\n\\nthe conveyance reads what the respondent No.8 says, however this document is\\n\\nvery old one. Thereafter there has been reallocation of area of Kolkata City.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">      In terms of our order the District Magistrate/Collector has sent a report\\n\\nwith a document stating that the premises No. 9/5, Rajendra Roychudhury Lane\\n\\nis within Ward No. 1 of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Kashipore Police Station\\n\\nand it is not within the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North) since the\\n\\nformation of the district of 24 Parganas (North) on 1st March 1986. Originally\\n\\ndistrict 24 Paraganas was one district, thereafter by and under a Notification in\\n\\nexercise of power conferred by the <a href=\"/doc/153625524/\" id=\"a_1\">Bengal District Act, 1836</a> read with Bengal Act\\n\\nof 1864 sub-<a href=\"/doc/760919/\" id=\"a_2\">section 2</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code 1973, the\\n\\nGovernment of West Bengal bifurcated the said 24 Parganas district into two\\n\\ndistricts namely 24 Parganas (South) and 24 Parganas (North). In this\\n\\nNotification in Schedule (A) various sub-divisions of the said newly formed\\n\\ndistrict 24 Parganas (North) has been enlisted with names of the Police Stations.\\n\\nIt appears that Kashipore Police Station within whose jurisdiction the aforesaid\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                         13</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                          14</span>\\n\\n\\nproperty is situated has not been included within the district of 24 Paraganas\\n\\n(North).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">       Subsequently it appears that Kashipore Police Station was included by\\n\\nsubsequent notification dated 18th September 1998 thereby Kashipore Police\\n\\nStation was brought within the Sadar sub-division of Alipore 24 Paraganas\\n\\n(South). The aforesaid report was challenged by Mr. Das&#x27;s client by filing those\\n\\ndocuments enumerated above. Mr. Das contends the word &quot;revenue&quot; is defined in\\n\\nWest Bengal Treasury Rules 2005. In Clause 10 of Rule 104 it defines the word\\n\\n&quot;revenue&quot; means revenue receipt of the State from the proceeds of taxes yields of\\n\\nordinary receipts, etc. including capital receipts, such as proceeds of sale of\\n\\ncapital assets, funds raised by borrowings, unfunded debts, etc.\\n\\n       Mr. Das draws our attention to the definition of &quot;Collector&quot; in the said Rule,\\n\\nbeing Clause (f): &quot;Collector means the Chief Officer in charge of the Revenue\\n\\nadministration of a district and overall charge of treasuries within the district&quot;.\\n\\nThe documents furnished by Mr. Das&#x27;s client no doubt shows that collection of\\n\\nrevenue namely Sales Tax/VAT, revenue arising out of the Registrar of Stamp\\n\\nRevenue and collection of Professional Taxes are collected in relation to this\\n\\npremises at a place situate within the jurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North).\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">       In our considered view most reliable and acceptable document is the\\n\\ninformation and report submitted by the District Collector showing that the\\n\\naforesaid place is not situated within the jurisdiction of revenue jurisdiction of\\n\\n24 Paraganas (North). Circles under Sales Tax (now VAT) is      not    synonymous\\n\\nwith   the term   Revenue     District. According to us various circles have been\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                         14</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                          15</span>\\n\\n\\ncreated for convenient collection of Sales Tax. Therefore, at present as many as\\n\\n16 Circles have been created whereas there are more than sixteen revenue\\n\\ndistricts. It appears that those 16 Circles include various places covering more\\n\\nthan one district. In our view these circles cannot be read with reference to\\n\\nrevenue district. Similarly the receipts for payment of taxes to motor vehicles\\n\\ndepartment is not the clinching factor as the said document might have been\\n\\nregistered in that district. There is no bar for any person to get his vehicle\\n\\nregistered in any other district on fulfilling requisite conditions    and he may\\n\\noperate the vehicle in other district. The certificate issued by the Director of\\n\\nRegistration of Stamp Revenue, West Bengal is not the determinative material to\\n\\nhold that the said premises is within the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas\\n\\n(North). The district mentioned in the registered deed of conveyance in our\\n\\nconsidered opinion is not the revenue district as this conveyance was not\\n\\nregistered in the concerned Registration Office in the district. The revenue district\\n\\nmeans and includes as mentioned in the last report of the D.M. supported by\\n\\ndocuments which are public documents, these documents are conclusive proof of\\n\\nthe contents thereof. What does it mean by revenue district is to be understood\\n\\nbest by the Indian Oil Corporation authorities as appropriately urged by Mr.\\n\\nSafiullah. In their affidavit they have accepted that the residence of Sharmila\\n\\ndoes not fall within the revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North). It is\\n\\nappropriate to record that while giving reply to the show-cause notice issued by\\n\\nIOC on 12th October 2004 Sharmila in her reply never claimed that she is the\\n\\nresident of revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North). In second paragraph in\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                         15</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                          16</span>\\n\\n\\nher reply being letter dated 4th May, 1994 (at page 66 of the Paper Book)\\n\\nshe stated as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      &quot;I applied as other district candidate along with the residence Certificate\\n\\nfrom Deputy Commissioner of Police, North Calcutta where it is clearly\\n\\nmentioned district Calcutta&quot;. In view of this admission and while taking note of\\n\\nthis statement IOC treated Sharmila was not resident of revenue jurisdiction of\\n\\n24 Parganas (North). In support of its affidavit IOC relied on a document issued\\n\\nby the Office of the Director of Land Records and certificates of Joint Land\\n\\nReform Commissioner which shows that the aforesaid premises falls within the\\n\\narea of Kolkata Municipal Corporation being Ward No. 1, Kashipore Police\\n\\nStation of Kolkata Police which is within the revenue district of Kolkata. The most\\n\\nimportant and relevant factor is what is understood about the Revenue district\\n\\nby the IOC. According to them the said premises does not situates within 24\\n\\nParganas (North).\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      Hence considering the fact as discussed above and examining all the\\n\\ndocuments brought before us we are of the view that the residence of the\\n\\nrespondent No. 8 does not fall within the jurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North). It is\\n\\ncontended by Mr. Das that the appellant is also not the resident of revenue\\n\\njurisdiction of 24 Parganas (North). We are of the view this plea does not require\\n\\nany consideration since it is not the scope of the challenge before us. The scope\\n\\nof enquiry in this case was and is whether his client satisfies the condition of the\\n\\nresidential status or not.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\\n\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                         16</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                          17</span>\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      In view of the aforesaid situation when IOC has given preference to\\n\\nresident of concerned revenue district if other things being equal Sharmila\\n\\ncannot be preferred to other candidates. IOC in its affidavit asserts that three\\n\\ncandidates were chosen. If first candidate is found to be disqualified, second is\\n\\nchosen, similarly second was found to be ineligible third is chosen. Under the\\n\\ncircumstances as above we cannot accept the judgment of the learned Trial\\n\\nJudge as the same was not rendered on the acceptable materials as to the status\\n\\nof the residence of Sharmila. The same is accordingly set aside.\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      However, we are not oblivious of the fact that the respondent No. 8 has\\n\\nalready spent and further invested a huge amount for infrastructure to establish\\n\\nthe outlet of LPG in that area and started catering large number of consumers.\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      In the circumstances as above the IOC is the only authority who can take\\n\\ndecision what should be done. But going by the published norms and having\\n\\nnoted their stand taken the dealership in favour of Sharmila has to be set aside.\\n\\nConsequently the claim and contention of the appellant before us has to be\\n\\nconsidered meaning thereby it is to be examined whether he satisfies the\\n\\nresidential status or not to claim dealership in place of Sharmila.\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      This exercise shall be completed within three months from the date of\\n\\nreceipt of this order. Till then the existing arrangement regarding supply of LPG\\n\\nshall continue.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">\\n\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                         17</span>\\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                          18</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       We also desire IOC to consider whether it is possible even if the appellant\\n\\nis successful in satisfying the residential status and other conditions in obtaining\\n\\nthe dealership in place of Sharmila, the area of dealership can be bifurcated\\n\\nwithout affecting viability of the business of existing dealership. The reason being\\n\\nthe advertisements were issued in the year 2000 the population was much less\\n\\nthan in the year 2011 and the demand for supply of LPG must have gone up. In\\n\\nthat case Sharmila&#x27;s case may be considered as early as possible as soon as the\\n\\nappellant&#x27;s as directed above is considered. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.\\n\\nThere will be no order as to costs.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">      Urgent xerox certified copy of this order be supplied to the applicants.\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">                                                               (K.
