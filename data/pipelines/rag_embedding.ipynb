       "'The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, is an Act to define and amend the law relating to partnership. It is enacted as follows: 1. Short title, extent and commencement. (1) This Act may be called the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. (2) It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. (3) It shall come into force on the 1st day of October, 1932, except section 69, which shall come into force on the 1st day of October, 1933. 2. Definitions. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,— (a) an “act of a firm” means any act or omission by all the partners, or by any partner or agent of the firm which gives rise to a right enforceable by or against the firm; (b) “business” includes every trade, occupation and profession; (c) “prescribed” means prescribed by rules made under this Act; (d) “third party” used in relation to a firm or to a partner therein means any person who is not a partner in the firm; and (e) expressions used but not defined in this Act and defined in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), shall have the meanings assigned to them in that Act. 3. Application of provisions of Act 9 of 1872.— The unrepealed provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, shall continue to apply to firms. 4. Definition of “partnership”, “partner”, “firm” and “firm name”.— \"Partnership\" is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually “partners” and collectively a “firm”, and the name under which their business is carried on is called the “firm name”. 5. Partnership not created by status.— The relation of partnership arises from contract and not from status; and, in particular, the members of a Hindu undivided family carrying on a family business as such, or a Burmese Buddhist husband and wife carrying business as such, are not partners in such business. 6. Mode of determining existence of partnership.— In determining whether a group of persons is or is not a firm or whether a person is or is not a partner in a firm, regard shall be had to the real relation between the parties, as shown by all relevant facts taken together.
