(2) Any filing that is equivalent to a regular national filing under the domestic legislation of any country of the Union or under bilateral or multilateral treaties concluded between countries of the Union shall be recognized as giving rise to the right of priority. (3) By a regular national filing is meant any filing that is adequate to establish the date on which the application was filed in the country concerned, whatever may be the subsequent fate of the application. B. Consequently, any subsequent filing in any of the other countries of the Union before the expiration of the periods referred to above shall not be invalidated by reason of any acts accomplished in the interval, in particular, another filing, the publication or exploitation of the invention, the putting on sale of copies of the design, or the use of the mark, and such acts cannot give rise to any third-party right or any right of personal possession. Rights acquired by third parties before the date of the first application that serves as the basis for the right of priority are reserved in accordance with the domestic legislation of each country of the Union C. (1) The periods of priority referred to above shall be twelve months for patents and utility models, and six months for industrial designs and trademarks. (2) These periods shall start from the date of filing of the first application; the day of filing shall not be included in the period.

With respect to the elements not included in the application or applications whose priority is claimed, the filing of the subsequent application shall give rise to a right of priority under ordinary conditions. G.

(2) The applicant may also, on his own initiative, divide a patent application and preserve as the date of each divisional application the date of the initial application and the benefit of the right of priority, if any. Each country of the Union shall have the right to determine the conditions under which such division shall be authorized. H.

(1) In determining whether a mark is eligible for protection, all the factual circumstances must be taken into consideration, particularly the length of time the mark has been in use.

D. No person may benefit from the provisions of this Article if the mark for which he claims protection is not registered in the country of origin. E.

Consequently, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, having presented their full powers, recognized as in good and due form, have agreed as follows: Article 1 Establishment of a Union {{^{{> 2}}}} The countries to which this Convention applies constitute a Union for the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works. Article 2 Protected Works: 1. “Literary and artistic works”; 2. Possible requirement of fixation; 3. Derivative works; 4. Official texts; 5. Collections; 6. Obligation to protect; beneficiaries of protection; 7. Works of applied art and industrial designs; 8. News (1) The expression “literary and artistic works” shall include every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as books, pamphlets and other writings; lectures, addresses, sermons and other works of the same nature; dramatic or dramatico-musical works; choreographic works and entertainments in dumb show; musical compositions with or without words; cinematographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; works of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving and lithography; photographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; works of applied art; illustrations, maps, plans, sketches and three-dimensional works relative to geography, topography, architecture or science. (2) It shall, however, be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form. (3) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work. (4) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the protection to be granted to official texts of a legislative, administrative and legal nature, and to official translations of such texts. (5) Collections of literary or artistic works such as encyclopaedias and anthologies which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections. (6) The works mentioned in this Article shall enjoy protection in all countries of the Union. This protection shall operate for the benefit of the author and his successors in title. (7) Subject to the provisions of Article\\xa07(4) of this Convention, it shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the extent of the application of their laws to works of applied art and industrial designs and models, as well as the conditions under which such works, designs and models shall be protected. Works protected in the country of origin solely as designs and models shall be entitled in another country of the Union only to such special protection as is granted in that country to designs and models; however, if no such special protection is granted in that country, such works shall be protected as artistic works. (8) The protection of this Convention shall not apply to news of the day or to miscellaneous facts having the character of mere items of press information. Article 2bis Possible Limitation of Protection of Certain Works: 1. Certain speeches; 2. Certain uses of lectures and addresses; 3. Right to make collections of such works (1) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to exclude, wholly or in part, from the protection provided by the preceding Article political speeches and speeches delivered in the course of legal proceedings. (2) It shall also be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which lectures, addresses and other works of the same nature which are delivered in public may be reproduced by the press, broadcast, communicated to the public by wire and made the subject of public communication as envisaged in Article\\xa011bis(1) of this Convention, when such use is justified by the informatory purpose. (3) Nevertheless, the author shall enjoy the exclusive right of making a collection of his works mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. Article 3 Criteria of Eligibility for Protection: 1. Nationality of author; place of publication of work; 2. Residence of author; 3: “Published” works; 4. “Simultaneously published” works (1) The protection of this Convention shall apply to: (a) authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, for their works, whether published or not; (b) authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of the Union, for their works first published in one of those countries, or simultaneously in a country outside the Union and in a country of the Union. (2) Authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of the Union but who have their habitual residence in one of them shall, for the purposes of this Convention, be assimilated to nationals of that country. (3) The expression “published works” means works published with the consent of their authors, whatever may be the means of manufacture of the copies, provided that the availability of such copies has been such as to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public, having regard to the nature of the work. The performance of a dramatic, dramatico-musical, cinematographic or musical work, the public recitation of a literary work, the communication by wire or the broadcasting of literary or artistic works, the exhibition of a work of art and the construction of a work of architecture shall not constitute publication. (4) A work shall be considered as having been published simultaneously in several countries if it has been published in two or more countries within thirty days of its first publication. Article 4 Criteria of Eligibility for Protection of Cinematographic Works, Works of Architecture and Certain Artistic Works The protection of this Convention shall apply, even if the conditions of Article\\xa03 are not fulfilled, to: (a) authors of cinematographic works the maker of which has his headquarters or habitual residence in one of the countries of the Union; (b) authors of works of architecture erected in a country of the Union or of other artistic works incorporated in a building or other structure located in a country of the Union.

In the country of origin; 4. “Country of origin” (1) Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention. (2) The enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Consequently, apart from the provisions of this Convention, the extent of protection, as well as the means of redress afforded to the author to protect his rights, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the country where protection is claimed. (3) Protection in the country of origin is governed by domestic law. However, when the author is not a national of the country of origin of the work for which he is protected under this Convention, he shall enjoy in that country the same rights as national authors. (4) The country of origin shall be considered to be: (a) in the case of works first published in a country of the Union, that country; in the case of works published simultaneously in several countries of the Union which grant different terms of protection, the country whose legislation grants the shortest term of protection; (b) in the case of works published simultaneously in a country outside the Union and in a country of the Union, the latter country; (c) in the case of unpublished works or of works first published in a country outside the Union, without simultaneous publication in a country of the Union, the country of the Union of which the author is a national, provided that: (i) when these are cinematographic works the maker of which has his headquarters or his habitual residence in a country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that country, and (ii) when these are works of architecture erected in a country of the Union or other artistic works incorporated in a building or other structure located in a country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that country. Article 6 Possible Restriction of Protection in Respect of Certain Works of Nationals of Certain Countries Outside the Union: 1. In the country of the first publication and in other countries; 2. No retroactivity; 3.\\xa0Notice (1) Where any country outside the Union fails to protect in an adequate manner the works of authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, the latter country may restrict the protection given to the works of authors who are, at the date of the first publication thereof, nationals of the other country and are not habitually resident in one of the countries of the Union. If the country of first publication avails itself of this right, the other countries of the Union shall not be required to grant to works thus subjected to special treatment a wider protection than that granted to them in the country of first publication. (2) No restrictions introduced by virtue of the preceding paragraph shall affect the rights which an author may have acquired in respect of a work published in a country of the Union before such restrictions were put into force. (3) The countries of the Union which restrict the grant of copyright in accordance with this Article shall give notice thereof to the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (hereinafter designated as “the Director General”) by a written declaration specifying the countries in regard to which protection is restricted, and the restrictions to which rights of authors who are nationals of those countries are subjected. The Director General shall immediately communicate this declaration to all the countries of the Union. Article 6bis Moral Rights: 1. To claim authorship; to object to certain modifications and other derogatory actions; 2. After the author\\'s death; 3. Means of redress (1) Independently of the author\\'s economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation. (2) The rights granted to the author in accordance with the preceding paragraph shall, after his death, be maintained, at least until the expiry of the economic rights, and shall be exercisable by the persons or institutions authorized by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed. However, those countries whose legislation, at the moment of their ratification of or accession to this Act, does not provide for the protection after the death of the author of all the rights set out in the preceding paragraph may provide that some of these rights may, after his death, cease to be maintained. (3) The means of redress for safeguarding the rights granted by this Article shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed. Article 7 Term of Protection: 1. Generally; 2. For cinematographic works; 3. For anonymous and pseudonymous works; 4. For photographic works and works of applied art; 5. Starting date of computation; 6. Longer terms; 7. Shorter terms; 8. Applicable law; “comparison” of terms (1) The term of protection granted by this Convention shall be the life of the author and fifty years after his death. (2) However, in the case of cinematographic works, the countries of the Union may provide that the term of protection shall expire fifty years after the work has been made available to the public with the consent of the author, or, failing such an event within fifty years from the making of such a work, fifty years after the making. (3) In the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works, the term of protection granted by this Convention shall expire fifty years after the work has been lawfully made available to the public. However, when the pseudonym adopted by the author leaves no doubt as to his identity, the term of protection shall be that provided in paragraph\\xa0(1) . If the author of an anonymous or pseudonymous work discloses his identity during the above-mentioned period, the term of protection applicable shall be that provided in paragraph\\xa0(1) . The countries of the Union shall not be required to protect anonymous or pseudonymous works in respect of which it is reasonable to presume that their author has been dead for fifty years. (4) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the term of protection of photographic works and that of works of applied art in so far as they are protected as artistic works; however, this term shall last at least until the end of a period of twenty-five years from the making of such a work. (5) The term of protection subsequent to the death of the author and the terms provided by paragraphs\\xa0(2) , (3) and (4) shall run from the date of death or of the event referred to in those paragraphs, but such terms shall always be deemed to begin on the first of January of the year following the death or such event. (6) The countries of the Union may grant a term of protection in excess of those provided by the preceding paragraphs. (7) Those countries of the Union bound by the Rome Act of this Convention which grant, in their national legislation in force at the time of signature of the present Act, shorter terms of protection than those provided for in the preceding paragraphs shall have the right to maintain such terms when ratifying or acceding to the present Act. (8) In any case, the term shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed; however, unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work.

Of works seen or heard in connection with current events (1) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction by the press, the broadcasting or the communication to the public by wire of articles published in newspapers or periodicals on current economic, political or religious topics, and of broadcast works of the same character, in cases in which the reproduction, broadcasting or such communication thereof is not expressly reserved. Nevertheless, the source must always be clearly indicated; the legal consequences of a breach of this obligation shall be determined by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed. (2) It shall also be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which, for the purpose of reporting current even ts by means of photography, cinematography, broadcasting or communication to the public by wire, literary or artistic works seen or heard in the course of the event may, to the extent justified by the informatory purpose, be reproduced and made available to the public.

(2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which the rights mentioned in the preceding paragraph may be exercised, but these conditions shall apply only in the countries where they have been prescribed.

In the absence of special agreements, the cam occasioned by the use of such means of transport shall be borne proportionally by the Parties to the conflict whose nationals are benefited thereby. Article 76. Censorship and examination:. The censoring of correspondence addressed to prisoners of war or despatched by them shall be done as quickly as possible. Mail shall be censored only by the despatching State and the receiving State, and once only by each. The examination of consignments intended for prisoners of war shall not be carried out under conditions that will expose the goods contained in them to deterioration; except in the case of written or printed matter, it shall be done in the presence of the addressee, or of a fellow-prisoner duly delegated by him. The delivery to prisoners of individual or collective consignments shall not be delayed under the pretext of difficulties of censorship. Any prohibition of correspondence ordered by Parties to the conflict, either for military or political reasons, shall be only temporary and its duration shall be as short as possible. Article 77. Preparation, execution and transmission of legal documents:. The Detaining Powers shall provide all facilities for the transmission, through the Protecting Power or the Central Prisoners of War Agency provided for in Article 123, of instruments, papers or documents intended for prisoners of war or despatched by them, especially powers of attorney and wills. In all cases they shall facilitate the preparation and execution of such documents on behalf of prisoners of war; in particular, they shall allow them to consult a lawyer and shall take what measures are necessary for the authentication of their signatures. SECTION VI RELATIONS BETWEEN PRISONERS OF WAR AND THE AUTHORITIES Chapter I COMPLAINTS OF PRISONERS OF WAR RESPECTING THE CONDITIONS OF CAPTIVITY Article 78. Complaints and requests: Prisoners of war shall have the right to make known to the military authorities in whose power they are, their requests regarding the conditions of captivity to which they are subjected. They shall also have the unrestricted right to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Powers either through their prisoners\\' representative or, if they consider it necessary, direct, in order to draw their attention to any points on which they may have complaints to make regarding their conditions of captivity. These requests and complaints shall not be limited nor considered to be a part of the correspondence quota referred to in Article 71. They must be transmitted immediately. Even if they are recognized to be unfounded, they may not give rise to any punishment. Prisoners\\' representatives may send periodic reports on the situation in the camps and the needs of the prisoners of war to the re. preventatives of the Protecting Powers, Chapter II PRISONERS OF WAR REPRESENTATIVES Article 79. Election: In all places where there are prisoners of war, except in those where there are officers, the prisoners shall freely elect by secret ballot, every six months, and also in case of vacancies, prisoners\\' representatives entrusted with representing them before the military authorities, the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and any other organization which may assist them. These prisoners\\' representatives shall be eligible for re-election. In camps for officers and persons of equivalent status or in mixed camps, the senior officer among the prisoners of war shall be recognised as the camp prisoners\\' representative. In camps for officers, he shall be assisted by one or more advisers chosen by the officers; in mixed camps, his assistants shall be chosen from among the prisoners of war who are not officers and shall be elected by them. Officer prisoners of war of the same nationality shall be stationed in labour camps for prisoners of war, for the purpose of carrying out the camp administration duties for which the prisoners of war are responsible. These officers may be elected as prisoners\\' representatives under the first paragraph of this Article. In such a case the assistants to the prisoners\\' representatives shall be chosen from among those prisoners of war who are not officers. Every representative elected must be approved by the Detaining Power before he has the right to commence his duties. Where the Detaining Power refuses to approve a prisoner of war elected by his fellow prisoners of war, it must inform the Protecting Power of the reason for such refusal. In all cases the prisoners\\' representative must have the same nationality, language and customs as the prisoners of war whom he represents. Thus, prisoners of war distributed in different sections of a camp, according to their nationality, language or customs, shall have for each section their own prisoners\\' representative, in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs. Article 80. Duties:. Prisoners\\' representatives shall further the physical, spiritual and intellectual well-being of prisoners of war. In particular, where the prisoners decide to organize amongst themselves a system of mutual assistance, this organization will be within the province of the prisoners\\' representative, in addition to the special duties entrusted to him by other provisions of the present Convention. Prisoners\\' representatives shall not be held responsible, simply by reason of their duties, for any offences committed by prisoners of war. Article 81. Prerogatives: Prisoners\\' representatives shall not be required to perform any other work, if the accomplishment of their duties is thereby made more difficult. Prisoners\\' representatives may appoint from amongst the prisoners such assistants as they may require. All material facilities shall be granted them, particularly a certain freedom of movement necessary for the accomplishment of their duties (inspection of labour detachments, receipt of supplies, etc.). Prisoners\\' representatives shall be permitted to visit premises where prisoners of war are detained, and every prisoner of war shall have the right to consult freely his prisoners\\' representative. All facilities shall likewise be accorded to the prisoners\\' representatives for communication by post and telegraph with the detaining authorities, the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and their delegates, the Mixed Medical Commissions and with the bodies which give assistance to prisoners of war. Prisoners\\' representatives of labour detachments shall enjoy the same facilities for communication with the prisoners\\' representatives of the principal camp. Such communications shall not be restricted, nor considered as forming a part of the quota-mentioned in Article 71. Prisoners\\' representatives who are transferred shall be allowed a reasonable time to acquaint their successors with current affairs. In case of dismissal, the reasons therefor shall be communicated to the Protecting Power. Chapter III PENAL AND DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS 1. General provisions Article 82. Applicable legislation: A prisoner of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in the armed forces of the Detaining Power; the Detaining Power shall be justified in taking judicial or disciplinary measures in respect of any offence committed by a prisoner of war against such laws, regulations or orders. However, no proceedings or punishments contrary to the provisions of this Chapter shall be allowed. If any law, regulation or order of the Detaining Power shall declare acts committed by a prisoner of war to be punishable, whereas the same acts would not be punishable if committed by a member of the forces of the Detaining Power, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishments only. Article 83. Choice of disciplinary of judicial proceedings:. In deciding whether proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by a prisoner of war shall be judicial or disciplinary, the Detaining Power shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise the greatest leniency and adopt, wherever possible, disciplinary rather than judicial measures. Article 84. Courts:. A prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court unless the existing laws of the Detaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in respect of the particular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war. In no circumstances whatever shall a prisoner of war be tried by a court of any kind which does not offer the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality as generally recognized, and, in particular, the procedure of which does not afford the accused the rights and means of defence provided for in Article 105. Article 85. Offences committed before capture:. Prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture shall retain, even if convicted, the benefits of the present Convention. Article 86. \"Non bis in idem.\":. No prisoner of war may be punished more than once for the same act or on the same charge. Note : Does this mean that the prisoner of war gets immunity from punishment for continuing such conduct, after having been once punshied therefor? Article 87. Penalties:. Prisoners of war may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts of the Detaining Power to any penalties except those provided for in respect of members of the armed forces of the said Power who have committed the same acts. When fixing the penalty, the courts or authorities of the Detaining Power shall take into consideration, to the widest extent possible, the fact that the accused, not being a national of the Detaining Power, is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance, and that he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will. The said courts or authorities shall be at liberty to reduce the penalty provided for the violation of which the prisoner of war is accused, and shall therefore not be bound to apply the minimum penalty prescribed. Collective punishment for individual acts, corporal punishments imprisonment in premises without daylight and, in general, any form of torture or cruelty, are forbidden. No prisoner of war may be deprived of his rank by the Detaining Power, or prevented from wearing his badges. Article 88. Execution of Penalties:. Officers, non-commissioned officers and men who are prisoners of war undergoing a disciplinary or judicial punishment, shall not be subjected to more severe treatment than that applied in respect of the same punishment to members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power of equivalent rank. A woman prisoner of war shall not be awarded or sentenced to a punishment more severe, or treated whilst undergoing punishment more severely, than a woman member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power dealt with for a similar offence. In no case may a woman prisoner of war be awarded or sentenced to a punishment more severe, or treated whilst undergoing punishment more severely, than a male member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power dealt with for a similar offence. Prisoners of war who have served disciplinary or judicial sentences may not be treated differently from other prisoners of war. II. Disciplinary sanctions Article 89. General observations: The disciplinary punishment applicable to prisoners of war are the following:- I. Forms of Punishment:(1) A fine which shall not exceed 50 per cent. of the advances of pay and working pay which the prisoner of war would otherwise receive under the provisions of Articles 60 and 62 during a period of not more than thirty days. (2) Discontinuance of privileges granted over and above the treatment provided for by the present Convention. (3) Fatigue duties not exceeding two hours daily. (4) Confinement. The punishment referred to under (3) shall not be applied to officers. In no case shall disciplinary punishments be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to the health of prisoners of war. Article 90. II. Duration of punishments:. The duration of any single punishment shall in no case exceed thirty days. Any period of confinement awaiting the hearing of a disciplinary offence or the award of disciplinary punishment shall be deducted from an award pronounced against a prisoner of war. The maximum of thirty days provided above may not be exceeded, even if the prisoner of war is answerable for several acts at the same time when he is awarded punishment, whether such acts are related or not. The period between the pronouncing of an award of disciplinary punishment and its execution shall not exceed one month. When a prisoner of war is awarded a further disciplinary punishment, a period of at least three days shall elapse between the execution of any two of the punishments, if the duration of one of these is ten days or more. Article 91. Escapes. I. Successful escape:. The escape of a prisoner of war shall be deemed to have succeeded when:- (1) he has joined the armed forces of the power on which he depends, or those of an allied power; (2) he has left the territory under the control of the DetainIng Power, or of an ally of the said power; (3) he has joined a ship flying the Rag of a power on which he depends, or of an allied Power, in the territorial waters of the Detaining Power, the said ship not being under the control of the last named Power. Prisoners of war who have made good their escape in the sense of this Article and who are recaptured, shall not be liable to any punishment in respect of their previous escape. Article 92 II. Unsuccessful escape:. A prisoner of war who attempts to escape and is recaptured before having made good his escape in the sense of Article, 91 shall be liable only to a disciplinary punishment, in respect of this act, even if it is a repeated offence. A prisoner of war who is recaptured shall be handed over without delay to the competent military authority. Article 88, fourth paragraph, notwithstanding, prisoners of war punished as a result of an unsuccessful escape may be subjected to special surveillance. Such surveillance must not affect the state of their health, must be\\' undergone in a prisoner of war camp, and must not entail the suppression of any of the safeguards granted them by the present Convention. Article 93 III. Connected offences:. Escape or attempt to escape, even if it is a repeated offence, shall not be deemed an aggravating circumstance if the prisoner of war is subjected to trial by judicial proceedings in respect of an offence committed during his escape or attempt to escape. In conformity with the principle stated in Article 83, offences committed by prisoners of war with the sole intention of facilitating their escape and which do not entail any violence against life or limb, such as offences against public property, theft without intention of self-enrichment, the drawing up or use of false papers, or the wearing of civilian clothing, shall occasion disciplinary punishment only. Prisoners of war who aid or abet an escape or an attempt to escape shall be liable on this count to disciplinary punishment only. Article 94 IV. Notification of recapture:. If an escaped prisoner of war is recaptured, the Power on which he depends shall be notified thereof in the manner defined in Article 122, provided notification of his escape has been made. Article 95. Procedure. I. Confinement awaiting hearing:. A prisoner of war accused of an offence against discipline shall not be kept in confinement pending the hearing unless a member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power would be so kept if he were accused of a similar offence, or if it is essential in the interests of camp order and discipline. Any period spent by a prisoner of war in confinement awaiting the disposal of an offence against discipline shall be reduced to an absolute minimum and shall not exceed fourteen days. The provisions of Articles 97 and 98 of this Chapter shall apply to prisoners of war who are in confinement awaiting the disposal of offences against discipline. Article 96 II. Competent authorities and right of defence:. Acts which constitute offences against discipline shall be investigated immediately. Without prejudice to the competence of courts and superior military authorities, disciplinary punishment may be ordered only by an officer having disciplinary powers in his capacity as camp commander, or by a responsible officer who replaces him or to whom he has delegated his disciplinary powers. In no case may such powers be delegated to a prisoner of war or be exercised by a prisoner of war. Before any disciplinary award is pronounced, the accused shall be given precise information regarding the offences of which he is accused, and given an opportunity of explaining his conduct and of defending himself. He shall be permitted, in particular, to call witnesses and to have recourse, if necessary, to the services of a qualified interpreter. The decision shall be announced to the accused prisoner of war and to the prisoners\\' representative. A record of disciplinary punishments shall be maintained by the camp commander and shall be open to inspection by representatives of the Protecting Power. Article 97. Execution of punishment. I. Premises:. Prisoners of war shall not in any case be transferred to penitentiary establishments (prisons, penitentiaries, convict prisons, etc.) to undergo disciplinary punishment therein. All premises in which disciplinary punishments are undergone shall conform to the sanitary requirements set forth in Article 25. A prisoner of war undergoing punishment shall be enabled to keep himself in a state of cleanliness, in conformity with Article 29. Officers and persons of equivalent status shall not be lodged in the same quarters as non-commissioned officers or men. Women prisoners of war undergoing disciplinary punishment shall be confined in separate quarters from male prisoners of war and shall be under the immediate supervision of women. Article 98. II. Essential safeguards:. A prisoner of war undergoing confinement as a disciplinary punishment, shall continue to enjoy the benefits of the provisions of this Convention except in so far as these are necessarily rendered inapplicable by the mere fact that he is confined. In no case may he be deprived of the benefits of the provisions of Articles 78 and 126. A prisoner of war awarded disciplinary punishment may not be deprived of the prerogatives attached to his rank. Prisoners of war awarded disciplinary punishment shall be allowed to exercise and to stay in the open air at least two hours daily. They shall be allowed, on their request, to be present at the daily medical inspections. They shall receive the attention which their state of health requires and, if necessary, shall be removed to the camp infirmary or to a hospital. They shall have permission to read and write, likewise to send and receive letters. Parcels and remittances of money however, may be withheld from them until the completion of the punishment; they shall meanwhile be entrusted to the prisoners\\' representative, who will hand over to the infirmary the perishable goods contained in such parcels. III. Judicial proceedings Article 99. Essential rules. I. General principles: No prisoner of war may be tried or sentenced for an act which is not forbidden by the law of the Detaining Power or by International Law, in force at the time the said act was committed. No moral or physical coercion may be exerted on a prisoner of war in order to induce him to admit himself guilty of the act of which he is accused. No prisoner of war may be convicted without having had an opportunity to present his defence and the assistance of a qualified advocate or counsel. Article 100. II. Death penalty:. Prisoners of war and the Protecting Powers shall be informed, as soon as possible, of the offences which are punishable by the death sentence under the laws of the Detaining Power. Other offences shall not thereafter be made punishable by the death penalty without the concurrence of the Power on which the prisoners of war depend. The death sentence cannot be pronounced on a prisoner of war unless the attention of the court has, in accordance with Article 87, second paragraph, been particularly called to the fact that since the accused is not a national of the Detaining Power, he is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance, and that he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will. Article 101. III. Delay in execution of the death penalty:. If the death penalty is pronounced on a prisoner of war, the sentence shall not be executed before the expiration of a period of at least six months from the date when the Protecting Power receives, at an indicated address, the detailed communication provided for in Article 107. Article 102. Procedure. I. Conditions for validity of sentence:. A prisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power, and if furthermore, the provisions of the present Chapter have been observed. Article 103. II. Confinement awaiting trial (Deduction from sentence, treatment):. Judicial investigations relating to a prisoner of war shall be conducted as rapidly as circumstances permit and so that his trial shall take place as soon as possible. A prisoner of war shall not be confined while awaiting trial unless a member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power would be so confined if he were accused of a similar offence, or if it is essential to do so in the interests of national security. In no circumstances shall this confinement exceed three months. Any period spent by a prisoner of war in confinement awaiting trial shall be deducted from any sentence of imprisonment passed upon him and taken into account in fixing any penalty. The provisions of Articles 97 and 98 of this Chapter shall apply to a prisoner of war whilst in confinement awaiting trial. Article 104. Notification of proceedings:. In any case in which the Detaining Power has decided to institute judicial proceedings against a prisoner of war, it shall notify the Protecting Power as soon as possible and at least three weeks before the opening of the trial. This period of three weeks shall run as from the day on which such notification reaches the Protecting Power at the address previously indicated by the latter to the Detaining Power. The said notification shall contain the following information:- (1) Surname and first names of the prisoner of war, his rank, his army, regimental, personal or serial number, his date of birth, and his profession or trade, if any; (2) Place of internment or confinement; (3) Specification of the charge or charges on which the prisoner of war is to be arraigned, giving the legal provisions applicable; (4) Designation of the court which will try the case, likewise the date and place fixed for the opening of the trial. The same communication shall be made by the Detaining Power to the prisoners\\' representative. If no evidence is submitted, at the opening of a trial that the notification referred to above was received by the Protecting Power, by the prisoner of war and by the prisoners\\' representative concerned, at least three weeks before the opening of the trial, then the latter cannot take place and must be adjourned. Article 105. IV. Rights and means of defence:. The prisoner of war shall be entitled to assistance by one of his prisoner comrades, to defence by a qualified advocate or counsel of his own choice, to the calling of witnesses and, if he deems necessary, to the services of a competent interpreter. He shall be advised of these rights by the Detaining Power in due time before the trial. Failing a choice by the prisoner of war, the Protecting Power shall find him an advocate or counsel, and shall have at least one week at its disposal for the purpose. The Detaining Power shall deliver to the said Power, on request, a list of persons qualified to present the defence. Failing a choice of an advocate or counsel by the prisoner of war or the Protecting Power, the Detaining Power shall appoint a competent advocate or counsel to conduct the defence. The advocate or counsel conducting the defence on behalf of the prisoner of war shall have at his disposal a period of two weeks at least before the opening of the trial, as well as the necessary facilities to prepare the defence of the accused. He may, in particular, freely visit the accused and interview him in private. He may also confer with any witnesses for the defence, including prisoners of war. He shall have the benefit of these facilities until the term of appeal of petition has expired. Particulars of the charge or charges on which the prisoner of war is to be arraigned, as well as the documents which are generally communicated to the accused by virtue of the laws in force in the armed forces of the Detaining Power, shall be communicated to the accused prisoner of war in a language which he understands, and in good time before the opening of the trial. The same communication in the same circumstances shall be made to the advocate or counsel conducting the defence on behalf of the prisoner of war. The representatives of the Protecting Power shall be entitled to attend the trial of the case, unless, exceptionally, this is held in camera in the interest of State security. In such a case the Detaining Power shall advise the Protecting Power accordingly. Article 106. V. Appeals:. Every prisoner of war shall have, in the same manner as the. members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power, the right of appeal or petition from any sentence pronounced upon him, with a view to the quashing or revising of the sentence or the reopening of the trial. He shall be fully informed of his right to appeal or petition and of the time limit within which he may do so. Article 107. VI. Notification of findings and sentence:. Any judgment and sentence pronounced upon a prisoner of war shall be immediately reported to the Protecting Power in the form of a summary communication, which shall also indicate whether he has the right of appeal with a view to the quashing of the sentence or the reopening of the trial. This communication shall likewise be sent to the prisoner\\'s representative concerned. It shall also be sent to the accused prisoner of war in a language he understands, if the sentence was not pronounced in his presence. The Detaining Power shall also immediately communicate to the Protecting Power the decision of the prisoner of war to use or to waive his right of appeal. Furthermore, if a prisoner of war is finally convicted or If a sentence pronounced on a prisoner of war in the first instance is a death sentence, the Detaining Power shall as soon as possible address to the Protecting Power a detailed communication containing:- (1) the precise wording of the finding and sentence; (2) a summarized report of any preliminary investigation and of the trial emphasizing in particular the elements of the prosecution and the defence; (3) notification, where applicable, of the establishment where the sentence will be served. The communications provided for in the foregoing sub-paragraphs shall be sent to the Protecting Power at the address previously made known to the Detaining Power. Article 108. Execution of penalties, penal regulations:. Sentences pronounced on prisoners of, war after a conviction has become duly enforceable, shall be served in the same establishments and under the same conditions as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power. These conditions shall in all cases conform to the requirements of health and humanity. A woman \\'prisoner of war on whom such a sentence has been pronounced shall be confined in separate quarters and shall be under the supervision of women. In any case, prisoners of war sentenced to a penalty depriving them of their liberty shall retain the \\'benefit of the provisions of Articles 78 and 126 of the present Convention. Furthermore, they shall be entitled to receive and despatch correspondence, to receive at least one relief parcel monthly, to take regular exercise in the open air, to have the medical care required by their state of health, and the spiritual assistance they may desire. Penalties to which they may be subjected shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 87, third paragraph. Part IV TERMINATION OF CAPTIVITY SECTION I DIRECT REPATRIATION AND ACCOMMODATION IN NEUTRAL COUNTRIES Article 109. General observations: Subject to the provisions of the third paragraph of this Article, Parties to the conflict ore bound to send back to their own country, regardless of number or rank, seriously wounded and seriously sick prisoners of war, after having cared for them until they are fit to travel, in accordance with the first paragraph of the following Article. Throughout the duration of hostilities, Parties to the conflict shall endeavour, with the co-operation of the neutral Powers concerned, to make arrangements for the accommodation in neutral countries of the sick and wounded prisoners of war referred to in the second paragraph of the following Article. They may, in addition, conclude agreements with a view to the direct repatriation or internment in a neutral country of able-bodied prisoners of war who have undergone a long period of captivity. No sick or injured prisoner of war who is eligible for repatriation under the first paragraph of this Article, may be repatriated against his will during hostilities. Article 110. Cases of repatriation and accommodation: The following shall be repatriated direct-.- (1) Incurably wounded and sick whose mental or physical fitness seems to have been gravely diminished. (2) Wounded and sick who, according to medical opinion, are not likely to recover within one year, whose condition requires treatment and whose mental or physical fitness seems to have been gravely diminished. (3) Wounded and sick who have recovered, but whose mental or physical fitness seems to have gravely and permanently diminished. The following may be accommodated in a neutral country:- (1) Wounded and sick whose recovery may be expected within one year of the date of the wound or the beginning of the illness, if treatment in a neutral country might increase the prospects of a more certain and speedy recovery. (2) Prisoners of war whose mental or physical health, according to medical opinion, is seriously threatened by continued captivity, but whose accommodation in a neutral country might remove such a threat. The conditions which prisoners of war accommodated in a neutral country must fulfil in order to permit their repatriation shall be fixed, as shall likewise their status, by agreement between the Powers concerned. In general, prisoners of war who have been accommodated in a neutral country, and who belong to the following categories, should be repatriated:- (1) Those whose state of health has deteriorated so as to fulfil the conditions laid down, for direct repatriation. (2) Those whose mental or physical powers remain, even after treatment, considerably impaired. If no special agreements are concluded between the Parties to the conflict concerned, to determine the cases of disablement or sickness entailing direct repatriation or accommodation in a neutral country, such cases shall be settled in accordance with the principles laid down in the Model Agreement concerning direct repatriation and accommodation in neutral countries of wounded and sick prisoners of war and in the Regulations concerning Mixed Medical Commissions annexed to the present Convention. Article 111. Internment in a neutral country: The Detaining Power, the Power on which the prisoners of war depend, and a neutral Power agreed upon by these two Powers, shall endeavour to conclude agreements which will enable prisoners of war to be interned in the territory of the said neutral Power until the close of hostilities.

Upon the outbreak of hostilities, Mixed Medical Commissions shall be appointed to examine sick and wounded prisoners of war, and to make all appropriate decisions regarding them. The appointment, duties and functioning of these Commissions shall be In conformity with the provisions of the Regulations annexed to the present Convention. However, prisoners of war who, in the opinion of the medical authorities of the Detaining Power, are manifestly seriously injured or seriously sick, may be repatriated without having to be examined by a Mixed Medical Commission.

Article 114. Prisoners meeting with accidents:. Prisoners of war who meet with accidents shall, unless the injury is self-inflicted, have the benefit of the provisions of this Convention as regards repatriation or accommodation in a neutral country. Article 115. Prisoners serving a sentence:. No prisoner of war on whom a disciplinary punishment has been imposed and who is eligible for repatriation or for accommodation in a neutral country, may be kept back on the plea that he has not\\' undergone his punishment.

SECTION II RELEASE AND REPATRIATION OF PRISONERS OF WAR AT THE CLOSE OF HOSTILITIES Article 118. Release and repatriation: Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. In the absence of stipulations to the above effect in any agreement concluded between the Parties to the conflict with a view to the cessation of hostilities, or failing any such agreement, each of the Detaining Powers shall itself establish and execute without delay a plan of repatriation in conformity with the principle laid down In the foregoing paragraph. In either case, the measures adopted shall be brought to the knowledge of the prisoners of war. The costs of repatriation of prisoners of war shall in all cases be equitably apportioned between the Detaining Power and the Power on which the prisoners depend. This apportionment shall be carried out on the following basis: (a) If the two Powers are contiguous, the Power on which the prisoners of war depend shall bear the cost of repatriation from the frontiers of the Detaining Power. (b) If the two Powers are not contiguous, the Detaining Power shall bear the costs of transport of prisoners of war over its own territory as far as its frontier or its port of embarkation nearest to the territory of the Power on which the prisoners of war depend. The Parties concerned shall agree between themselves as to the equitable apportionment of the remaining costs of the repatriation. The conclusion of this agreement shall in no circumstances justify any delay in the repatriation of the prisoners of war. Article 119. Details of procedure:. Repatriation shall be effected in conditions similar to those laid down in Articles 46 to 48 inclusive of the present Convention for the transfer of prisoners of war, having regard to the provisions of Article 118 and to those of the following paragraphs.

The weight of such baggage may be limited, if the conditions of repatriation so require, to what each prisoner can reasonably carry. Each prisoner shall in all cases be authorised to carry at least twenty-five kilograms. The other personal effects of the repatriated prisoner shall be left in the charge of the Detaining Power which shall have them forwarded to him as soon as it has concluded an agreement to this effect, regulating the conditions of transport and the payment of the costs involved, with the Power on which the prisoner depends. Prisoners of war against whom criminal proceedings for an indictable offence are pending may be detained until the end of such proceedings, and, if necessary, until the completion of the punishment. The same shall apply to prisoners of war already convicted for an indictable offence. Parties to the conflict shall communicate to each other the names of any prisoners of war who are detained until the end of the proceedings or until punishment has been completed. By agreement between the Parties to the conflict, commissions shall be established for the purpose of searching for dispersed prisoners of war and of assuring their repatriation with the least possible delay. SECTION III DEATH OF PRISONERS OF WAR Article 120. Wills, death certificates, burial, cremation: Wills of prisoners of war shall be drawn up so as to satisfy the conditions of validity required by the legislation of their country of origin, which will take steps to inform the Detaining Power of its requirements in this respect.

Statement of Objects and Reasons:-A Convention on offences and certain other acts committed on board aircraft was drawn up at an international conference held in Tokyo in 1963 by the representatives of 61 Governments. A representative of the Government of India was also present at the conference. 2. The Convention, which has come to be referred to as the Tokyo Convention, came into force on the 4th December, 1969. Apart from the International Civil Aviation Organisation, International non-Governmental , Organisations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations (IFALPA) have urged upon States to ratify the Tokyo Convention. Presently the Convention has been ratified by 74 States. 3. The scope of the Convention is not an unlimited one and it specifically excludes offences of political, religious or racial nature. Further, the Convention, does not in any way interfere with the principle of sovereignty. The Convention provides that in cases of hijacking the control of the aircraft and passengers should be restored by contracting States. 4. The salient features of the Convention are:- (a) Nature of acts to which the Convention applies.-The Convention covers offences committed on board an aircraft which are against the penal laws of a State as also acts which may or do jeopardise the safety of the aircraft, or of persons or property therein, or good order and discipline on board an aircraft. (b) Jurisdiction.-In respect of offences and. acts committed on board an aircraft, the Convention, without prejudice to the exercise of jurisdiction by the State over whose air space the offence was committed, confers jurisdiction on the State of registration of the aircraft. (c) Powers of commanders.-The Convention empowers the aircraft' commander and other members of the crew to take reasonable measures including restraint, to prevent commission of the acts to which the Convention applies and to disembark the offender, or to deliver him to the local authorities, in the State where the aircraft lands. (d) Aircraft to which the Convention does not apply.-The Convention does not apply to aircraft used in military, customs or police services. 5. The increasing number of hijacking incidents in recent years has lent urgency to the task of evolving uniform measures by all the States with a view to effectively dealing with such incidents. The Convention marks the first determined effort on the part of the international community to meet the situation arising out of such incidents of hijacking. 6.

Article 33 Depositary The Director General of WIPO is the depositary of this Treaty. 1 Agreed statement concerning Article 1(2): It is understood that Article 1(2) clarifies the relationship between rights in phonograms under this Treaty and copyright in works embodied in the phonograms. In cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in the phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the author does not cease to exist because the authorization of the performer or producer is also required, and vice versa. It is further understood that nothing in Article 1(2) precludes a Contracting Party from providing exclusive rights to a performer or producer of phonograms beyond those required to be provided under this Treaty. 2 Agreed statement concerning Article 2(b): It is understood that the definition of phonogram provided in Article 2(b) does not suggest that rights in the phonogram are in any way affected through their incorporation into a cinematographic or other audiovisual work. 3 Agreed statement concerning Articles 2(e), 8, 9, 12, and 13: As used in these Articles, the expressions “copies” and “original and copies,” being subject to the right of distribution and the right of rental under the said Articles, refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects. 4 Agreed statement concerning Article 3: It is understood that the reference in Articles 5(a) and\\xa016(a)(iv) of the Rome Convention to “national of another Contracting State” will, when applied to this Treaty, mean, in regard to an intergovernmental organization that is a Contracting Party to this Treaty, a national of one of the countries that is a member of that organization. 5 Agreed statement concerning Article 3(2): For the application of Article 3(2), it is understood that fixation means the finalization of the master tape (“bande-mère”). 6 Agreed statement concerning Articles 7, 11 and 16: The reproduction right, as set out in Articles 7 and 11, and the exceptions permitted thereunder through Article\\xa016, fully apply in the digital environment, in particular to the use of performances and phonograms in digital form. It is understood that the storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form in an electronic medium constitutes a reproduction within the meaning of these Articles. 7 Agreed statement concerning Article 15 It is understood that Article 15 does not represent a complete resolution of the level of rights of broadcasting and communication to the public that should be enjoyed by performers and phonogram producers in the digital age. Delegations were unable to achieve consensus on differing proposals for aspects of exclusivity to be provided in certain circumstances or for rights to be provided without the possibility of reservations, and have therefore left the issue to future resolution. 8 Agreed statement concerning Article 15: It is understood that Article 15 does not prevent the granting of the right conferred by this Article to performers of folklore and producers of phonograms recording folklore where such phonograms have not been published for commercial gain. 9 Agreed statement concerning Article 16: The agreed statement concerning Article 10 (on Limitations and Exceptions) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty is applicable mutatis mutandis also to Article 16 (on Limitations and Exceptions) of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. [The text of the agreed statement concerning Article 10 of the WCT reads as follows: “It is understood that the provisions of Article 10 permit Contracting Parties to carry forward and appropriately extend into the digital environment limitations and exceptions in their national laws which have been considered acceptable under the Berne Convention. Similarly, these provisions should be understood to permit Contracting Parties to devise new exceptions and limitations that are appropriate in the digital network environment. “It is also understood that Article 10(2) neither reduces nor extends the scope of applicability of the limitations and exceptions permitted by the Berne Convention.”] 10 Agreed statement concerning Article 19: The agreed statement concerning Article 12 (on Obligations concerning Rights Management Information) of the WIPO Copyright Treaty is applicable mutatis mutandis also to Article 19 (on Obligations concerning Rights Management Information) of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. [The text of the agreed statement concerning Article 12 of the WCT reads as follows: “It is understood that the reference to ‘infringement of any right covered by this Treaty or the Berne Convention’ includes both exclusive rights and rights of remuneration. “It is further understood that Contracting Parties will not rely on this Article to devise or implement rights management systems that would have the effect of imposing formalities which are not permitted under the Berne Convention or this Treaty, prohibiting the free morvement of goods or impeding the enjoyment of rights under this Treaty.”]'},\n",

Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits if that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2.

In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except in so far as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or in so far as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company\\'s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2.

In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political sub-division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. 5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8 Shipping and Air Transport 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation by that enterprise of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and of Article 7, profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from a voyage of a ship or aircraft where the principal purpose of the voyage is to transport passengers or property between places in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 3. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall mean profits derived by an enterprise described in paragraph 1 from the transportation by sea or air respectively of passengers, mail, livestock or goods carried on by owners or lessees or charterers of ships or aircraft including: (a) the sale of tickets for such transportation on behalf of other enterprises; (b) other activity directly connected with such transportation; and (c) the rental of ships or aircraft incidental to any activity directly connected with such transportation. 4. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State described in paragraph 1 from the use, maintenance, or rental of containers (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport of containers) used in connection with the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 4 shall also apply to profits from participation in a pool, a joint business, or an international operating agency. 6. For the purposes of this Article, interest on funds connected with the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be regarded as profits derived from the operation of such ships or aircraft, and the provisions of Article 11 shall not apply in relation to such interest. 7. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to a drilling rig or any vessel the principal function of which is the performance of activities other than the transportation of goods or passengers. Article 9 Associated Enterprises 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any income which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the income of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the income of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - income on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the income so included is income which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on that income. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 3. A Contracting State shall not change the income of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its national laws and, in any case, after five years from the end of the year in which the income which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud, wilful default or neglect. Article 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; (b) 25 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not affect the taxation of the company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 4. The term \"dividends\" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company\\'s undistributed profits to a tax on the company\\'s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, (a) interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned State if: (i) the payer of the interest is the Government of that Contracting State or of a political subdivision or local authority thereof, (ii) the beneficial owner of the interest is the central bank of the other Contracting State, or (iii) the interest is paid to an agency or instrumentality (including a financial institution) which may be agreed upon in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; (b) (i) interest arising in India and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export Development Corporation, or (ii) interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of India shall be taxable only in India if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by the Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank). 4. The term \"interest\" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises. However, the term \"interest\" does not include income dealt with in Article 8 or in Article 10. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 7. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 12 Royalties and Fees for Included Services 1. Royalties and fees for included services arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties and fees for included services may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State; but if the beneficial owner of the royalties or fees for included services is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) in the case of royalties referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 3 and fees for included services as defined in this Article (other than services described in sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph): (i) during the first five taxable years for which this Agreement has effect, (A) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties or fees for included services as defined in this Article, where the payer of the royalties or fees is the Government of that Contracting State, a political subdivision or a public sector company, and (B) 20 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties or fees for included services in all other cases, and (ii) during the subsequent years, 15 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties or fees for included services; and (b) in the case of royalties referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 and fees for included services as defined in this Article that are ancillary and subsidiary to the enjoyment of the property for which payment is received under paragraph 3(b) of this Article, 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties or fees for included services. 3. The term \"royalties\" as used in this Article means: (a) payment of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of a literary, artistic, or scientific work, including cinematograph films or work on film tape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, including gains derived from the alienation of any such right or property which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition thereof; and (b) payments of any kind received as consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, other than payments derived by an enterprise described in paragraph 1 of Article 8 from activities described in paragraph 3(c) or 4 of Article 8. 4. For the purposes of this Article, \"fees for included services\" means payments of any kind to any person in consideration for the rendering of any technical or consultancy services (including through the provision of services of technical or other personnel) if such services: (a) are ancillary and subsidiary to the application or enjoyment of the right, property or information for which a payment described in paragraph 3 is received; or (b) make available technical knowledge, experience, skill, know-how, or processes or consist of the development and transfer of a technical plan or technical design. 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, \"fees for included services\" does not include amounts paid: (a) for services that are ancillary and subsidiary, as well as inextricably and essentially linked, to the sale of property other than a sale described in paragraph 3(a); (b) for services that are ancillary and subsidiary to the rental of ships, aircraft, containers or other equipment used in connection with the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic; (c) for teaching in or by educational institutions; (d) for services for the personal use of the individual or individuals making the payment; or (e) to an employee of the person making the payments or to any individual or firm of individuals (other than a company) for professional services as defined in Article 14. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties or fees for included services, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties or the fees for included services arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right, property or contract in respect of which the royalties or fees for included services are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 7. Royalties and fees for included services shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties or the fees for included services, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties or the fees for included services was incurred, and such royalties or fees for included services are borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties or fees for included services shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties or fees for included services, having regard to the use, right, information or services for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 13 Capital Gains 1. Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State and movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Gains from the alienation of any property, other than those referred to in paragraph 1, may be taxed in both Contracting States. Article 14 Independent Personal Services 1. Income derived by an individual or a firm of individuals (other than a company) who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other independent activities of a similar character shall be taxable only in that State. However, in the following circumstances such income may be taxed in the other Contracting State, that is to say: (a) if he has or had a fixed base regularly available to him in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing his activities; in that case only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base may be taxed in that other Contracting State; or (b) if his stay in the other Contracting State is for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the relevant fiscal year; or (c) if the remuneration for the services in the other Contracting State is either derived from residents of that other Contracting State or is borne by a permanent establishment which a person not resident in that other Contracting State has in that other Contracting State and such remuneration exceeds two thousand five hundred Canadian dollars ($2,500) or its equivalent in Indian currency in the relevant fiscal year. 2. The term \"professional services\" includes independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, surgeons, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants.

Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the relevant fiscal year; (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and (c) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State may be taxed in that State. Article 16 Directors\\' Fees Directors\\' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in his capacity as a member of the board of directors or a similar organ of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste or a musician, or an athlete, from his personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised in a Contracting State by an entertainer or an athlete accrues not to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person which provides the activities in that State, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in that Contracting State unless the entertainer, athlete, or other person establishes that neither the entertainer or athlete nor persons related thereto participate directly or indirectly in the profits of that other person in any manner, including the receipt of deferred remuneration, bonuses, fees, dividends, partnership distributions, or other distributions. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the visit to a Contracting State of the entertainer or the athlete is directly or indirectly supported, wholly or substantially, from the public funds of the other Contracting State, including any political subdivision, local authority or statutory body of that other State.

(b) However, such salaries, wages or similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that other State and the individual is a resident of that other State who: (i) is a national of that other State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that other State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to salaries, wages and similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof.

Article 21 Other Income 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles, and arising in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

The laws in force in either of the Contracting States will continue to govern the taxation of income in the respective Contracting States except where provisions to the contrary are made in this Agreement. 2. In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: (a) Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions \\x97 which shall not affect the general principle hereof \\x97 and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in India on profits, income or gains arising in India shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains. (b) Subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the determination of the exempt surplus of a foreign affiliate and to any subsequent modification of those provisions \\x97 which shall not affect the general principle hereof \\x97 for the purpose of computing Canadian tax, a company which is a resident of Canada shall be allowed to deduct in computing its taxable income any dividend received by it out of the exempt surplus of a foreign affiliate which is a resident of India. (c) Where a resident of Canada owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement may be taxed in India, Canada shall allow as a deduction from the tax on capital of that resident an amount equal to the capital tax paid in India. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the capital tax (as computed before the deduction is given) which is attributable to the capital which may be taxed in India. (d) Where in accordance with any provision of the Agreement income derived or capital owned by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital. 3. In the case of India, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: (a) The amount of Canadian tax paid, under the laws of Canada and in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, by a resident of India, in respect of income from sources within Canada which has been subjected to tax both in India and Canada shall be allowed as a credit against the Indian tax payable in respect of such income but in an amount not exceeding that proportion of Indian tax which such income bears to the entire income chargeable to Indian tax. (b) Where a resident of India owns capital, which, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, may be taxed in Canada, India shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the capital of that resident an amount equal to the capital tax paid in Canada. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the capital tax (as computed before the deduction is given) which is attributable to the capital which may be taxed in Canada. Provided that income which in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement is not to be subjected to tax may be taken into account in calculating the rate of tax imposed. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 2(a), the term \"tax payable in India\" shall, with respect to a company which is a resident of Canada, be deemed to include any amount which would have been payable as Indian tax but for a deduction allowed in computing the taxable income or an exemption or reduction of tax granted for that year under: (a) sections 10(15)(iv), 10A, 32A (but not the part dealing with ships and aircraft), 80HH, 80HHD and 80IA (but not the part dealing with ships) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, as amended, so far as they were in force on and have not been modified since the date of signature of the Agreement, or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character; or (b) any other provision which may subsequently be made granting an exemption or reduction from tax which is agreed by the competent authorities of the Contracting States to be of a substantially similar character, if it has not been modified thereafter or has been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect its general character. Provided that relief from Canadian tax shall not be given by virtue of this paragraph in respect of income from any source if the income relates to a period starting more than ten fiscal years after the exemption from, or reduction of, Indian tax is first granted to the resident of Canada, in respect of that source. 5. For the purposes of this Article, profits, income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State which are taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with the Agreement shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other State. VI. Special Provisions Article 24 Non-Discrimination 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. 3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 4. (a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing on the earnings of a company, which is a resident of India, attributable to a permanent establishment in Canada, a tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a national of Canada, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed the rate specified in subparagraph 2(a) of Article 10 of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this provision, the term \"earnings\" means the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in Canada in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits by Canada. The provisions of this subparagraph shall also apply with respect to earnings from the disposition of immovable property situated in Canada by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property without a permanent establishment in Canada but only insofar as these earnings may be taxed in Canada under the provisions of Article 6 or paragraph 1 of Article 13. (b) A company which is a resident of Canada may be subject to tax in India at a rate higher than that applicable to Indian domestic companies. The difference in tax rate shall not, however, exceed 15 percentage points. 5. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected. 6. In this Article, the term \"taxation\" means taxes which are the subject of this Agreement. Article 25 Mutual Agreement Procedure 1. Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case in writing to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within two years from the first notification of the action which gives rise to taxation not in accordance with the Agreement. 2. The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. Article 26 Exchange of Information 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for the carrying out of this Agreement or of the domestic laws of the Contracting States (including the provisions thereof dealing with the prevention of fiscal evasion or fraud) concerning taxes covered by the Agreement insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 2. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and the administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 3. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of this Article, the other Contracting State shall endeavour to obtain the information to which the request relates in the same way as if its own taxation was involved notwithstanding the fact that the other State does not, at that time, need such information. If specifically requested by the competent authority of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State shall endeavour to provide information under this Article in the form requested, such as depositions of witnesses and copies of unedited original documents (including books, papers, statements, records, accounts or writings), to the same extent such depositions and documents can be obtained under the laws and administrative practices of that other State with respect to its own taxes. Article 27 Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of diplomatic agents or consular officers under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. Article 28 Miscellaneous Rules 1. The provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit or other allowance now or hereafter accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State. 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying the Agreement. 3. With respect to paragraph 3 of Article XXII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure relating to a tax to which any provision of this Agreement applies falls within the scope of this Agreement may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States.

B. Measures to Secure the Storage Facility and Storage Facility Preparation 7. Not later than when submitting its declaration of chemical weapons, a State Party shall take such measures as it considers appropriate to secure its storage facilities and shall prevent any movement of its chemical weapons out of the facilities, except their removal for destruction. 8. A State Party shall ensure that chemical weapons at its storage facilities are configured to allow ready access for verification in accordance with paragraphs 37 to 49. 9. While a storage facility remains closed for any movement of chemical weapons out of the facility other than their removal for destruction, a State Party may continue at the facility standard maintenance activities, including standard maintenance of chemical weapons; safety monitoring and physical security activities; and preparation of chemical weapons for destruction. 10. Maintenance activities of chemical weapons shall not include: (a) Replacement of agent or of munition bodies; (b) Modification of the original characteristics of munitions, or parts or components thereof. 11. All maintenance activities shall be subject to monitoring by the Technical Secretariat. C. Destruction Principles and methods for destruction of chemical weapons 12. \"Destruction of chemical weapons\" means a process by which chemicals are converted in an essentially irreversible way to a form unsuitable for production of chemical weapons, and which in an irreversible manner renders munitions and other devices unusable as such. 13. Each State Party shall determine how it shall destroy chemical weapons, except that the following processes may not be used: dumping in any body of water, land burial or open-pit burning. It shall destroy chemical weapons only at specifically designated and appropriately designed and equipped facilities. 14. Each State Party shall ensure that its chemical weapons destruction facilities are constructed and operated in a manner to ensure the destruction of the chemical weapons; and that the destruction process can be verified under the provisions of this Convention. Order of destruction 15. the order of destruction of chemical weapons is based on the obligations specified in Article I and the other Articles, including obligations regarding systematic on-site verification. It takes into account interests of States Parties for undiminished security during the destruction period; confidence building in the early part of the destruction stage; gradual acquisition of experience in the course of destroying chemical weapons; and applicability irrespective of the actual composition of the stockpiles and the methods chosen for the destruction of the chemical weapons. the order of destruction is based on the principle of levelling out. 16. For the purpose of destruction, chemical weapons declared by each State Party shall be divided into three categories: Category 1: Chemical weapons on the basis of Schedule 1 chemicals and their parts and components; Category 2: Chemical weapons on the basis of all other chemicals and their parts and components; Category 3: Unfilled munitions and devices, and equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with employment of chemical weapons. 17. A State Party shall start. - (a) the destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons not later than two years after this Convention enters into force for it, and shall complete the destruction not later than 10 years after entry into force of this Convention. A State Party shall destroy chemical weapons in accordance with the following destruction deadlines: (i) Phase 1: Not later than two years after entry into force of this Convention, testing of its first destruction facility shall be completed. Not less than 1 per cent. of the Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than three years after the entry into force of this Convention; (ii) Phase 2: Not less than 20 per cent. of the Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than five years after the entry into force of this Convention; (iii) Phase 3: Not less than 45 per cent. of the Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than seven years after the entry into force of this Convention; (iv) Phase 4: All Category 1 chemical weapons shall be destroyed not later than 10 years after the entry into force of this Convention; (b) the destruction of Category 2 chemical weapons not later than one year after this Convention enters into force for it and shall complete the destruction not later than five years after the entry into force of this Convention. Category 2 chemical weapons shall be destroyed in equal annual increments throughout the destruction period. the comparison factor for such weapons is the weight of the chemicals within Category 2; and (c) the destruction of Category 3 chemical weapons not later than one year after this Convention enters into force for it, and shall complete the destruction not later than five years after the entry into force of this Convention. Category 3 chemical weapons shall be destroyed in equal annual increments throughout the destruction period. the comparison factor for unfilled munitions and devices is expressed in nominal fill volume (m3) and for equipment in number of items. 18. For the destruction of binary chemical weapons the following shall apply: (a) For the purposes of the order of destruction, a declared quantity (in tonnes) of the key component intended for a specific toxic end-product shall be considered equivalent to the quantity (in tonnes) of this toxic end-product calculated on a stoichiometric basis assuming 100 per cent. yield; (b) A requirement to destroy a given quantity of the key component shall entail a requirement to destroy a corresponding quantity of the other component, calculated from the actual weight ratio of the components in the relevant type of binary chemical munition device; (c) If more of the other component is declared than is needed, based on the actual weight ratio between components, the excess shall be destroyed over the first two years after destruction operations begin; (d) At the end of each subsequent operational year a State Party may retain an amount of the other declared component that is determined on the basis of the actual weight ratio of the components in the relevant type of binary chemical munition device. 19. For multi-component chemical weapons the order of destruction shall be analogous to that envisaged for binary chemical weapons. Modification of intermediate destruction deadlines 20. the Executive Council shall review the general plans for destruction of chemical weapons, submitted pursuant to Article III, paragraph 1 (a) (v), and in accordance with paragraph 6, inter alia, to assess their conformity with the order of destruction set forth in paragraphs 15 to 19. the Executive Council shall consult with any State Party whose plan does not conform, with the objective of bringing the plan into conformity. 21. If a State Party, due to exceptional circumstances beyond its control, believes that it cannot achieve the level of destruction specified for Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 of the order of destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons, it may propose changes in those levels. Such a proposal must be made not later than 120 days after the entry into force of this Convention and shall contain a detailed explanation of the reasons for the proposal. 22. Each State Party shall take all necessary measures to ensure destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons in accordance with the destruction deadlines set forth in paragraph 17(a) as changed pursuant to paragraph 21. However, if a State Party believes that it will be unable to ensure the destruction of the percentage of Category 1 chemical weapons required by an intermediate destruction deadline, it may request the Executive Council to recommend to the Conference to grant an extension of its obligation to meet that deadline. Such a request must be made not less than 180 days before the intermediate destruction deadline and shall contain a detailed explanation of the reasons for the request and the plans of the State Party for ensuring that it will be able to fulfil its obligation to meet the next intermediate destruction deadline. 23. If an extension is granted, the State Party shall still be under the obligation to meet the cumulative destruction requirements set forth for the next destruction deadline. Extensions granted pursuant to this section shall not, in any way, modify the obligation of the State Party to destroy all Category 1 chemical weapons not later than 10 years after the entry into force of this Convention. Extension of the deadline for completion of destruction 24. If a State Party believes that it will be unable to ensure the destruction of all Category 1 chemical weapons not later than 10 years after the entry into force of this Convention, it may submit a request to the Executive Council for an extension of the deadline for completing the destruction of such chemical weapons. Such a request must be made not later than nine years after the entry into force of this Convention. 25. the request shall contain: (a) the duration of the proposed extension; (b) A detailed explanation of the reasons for the proposed extension; and (c) A detailed plan for destruction during the proposed extension and the remaining portion of the original 10-year period for destruction. 26. A decision on the request shall be taken by the Conference at its next session, on the recommendation of the Executive Council. Any extension shall be the minimum necessary, but in no case shall the deadline for a State Party to complete its destruction of all chemical weapons be extended beyond 15 years after the entry into force of this Convention. the Executive Council shall set conditions for the granting of the extension, including the specific verification measures deemed necessary as well as specific actions to be taken by the State Party to overcome problems in its destruction programme. Costs of verification during the extension period shall be allocated in accordance with Article IV, paragraph 16. 27. If an extension is granted, the State Party shall take appropriate measures to meet all subsequent deadlines. 28. the State Party shall continue to submit detailed annual plans for destruction in accordance with paragraph 29 and annual reports on the destruction of Category 1 chemical weapons in accordance with paragraph 36, until all Category 1 chemical weapons are destroyed. In addition, not later than at the end of each 90 days of the extension period, the State Party shall report to the Executive Council on its destruction activity. the Executive Council shall review progress towards completion of destruction and take the necessary measures to document this progress. All information concerning the destruction activities during the extension period shall be provided by the Executive Council to States Parties, upon request.

Annex On the Protection of Confidential Information (\"Confidentiality Annex\") A. General Principles For the Handling of Confidential Information 1. the obligation to protect confidential information shall pertain to the verification of both civil and military activities and facilities. Pursuant to the general obligations set forth in Article VIII, the Organization shall: (a) Require only the minimum amount of information and data necessary for the timely and efficient carrying out of its responsibilities under this Convention; (b) Take the necessary measures to ensure that inspectors and other staff members of the Technical Secretariat meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity; (c) Develop agreements and regulations to implement the provisions of this Convention and shall specify as precisely as possible the information to which the Organization shall be given access by a State Party. 2. the Director-General shall have the primary responsibility for ensuring the protection of confidential information. the Director-General shall establish a stringent regime governing the handling of confidential information by the Technical Secretariat, and in doing so, shall observe the following guidelines: (a) Information shall be considered confidential if: (i) It is so designated by the State Party from which the information was obtained and to which the information refers; or (ii) In the judgment of the Director-General, its unauthorised disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the State Party to which it refers or to the mechanisms for implementation of this Convention; (b) All data and documents obtained by the Technical Secretariat shall be evaluated by the appropriate unit of the Technical Secretariat in order to establish whether they contain confidential information. Data required by States Parties to be assured of the continued compliance with this Convention by other States Parties shall be routinely provided to them. Such data shall encompass: (i) the initial and annual reports and declarations provided by States Parties under Articles III, IV, V and VI, in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Verification Annex; (ii) General reports on the results and effectiveness of verification activities; and (iii) Information to be supplied to all States Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Convention; (c) No information obtained by the Organization in connection with the implementation of this Convention shall be published or otherwise released, except, as follows: (i) General information on the implementation of this Convention may be compiled and released publicly in accordance with the decisions of the Conference or the Executive Council; (ii) Any information may be released with the express consent of the State Party to which the information refers; (iii) Information classified as confidential shall be released by the Organization only through procedures which ensure that the release of information only occurs in strict conformity with the needs of this Convention. Such procedures shall be considered and approved by the Conference pursuant to Article VIII, paragraph 21 (i); (d) the level of sensitivity of confidential data or documents shall be established, based on criteria to be applied uniformly in order to ensure their appropriate handling and protection. For this purpose, a classification system shall be introduced, which by taking account of relevant work undertaken in the preparation of this Convention shall provide for clear criteria ensuring the inclusion of information into appropriate categories of confidentiality and the justified durability of the confidential nature of information. While providing for the necessary flexibility in its implementation the classification system shall protect the rights of States Parties providing confidential information.  A classification system shall be considered and approved by the Conference pursuant to Article VIII, paragraph 21 (i); (e) Confidential information shall be stored securely at the premises of the Organization. Some data or documents may also be stored with the National Authority of a State Party. Sensitive information, including, inter alia, photographs, plans and other documents required only for the inspection of a specific facility may be kept under lock and key at this facility; (f) To the greatest extent consistent with the effective implementation of the verification provisions of this Convention, information shall be handled and stored by the Technical Secretariat in a form that precludes direct identification of the facility to which it pertains; (g) the amount of confidential information removed from a facility shall be kept to the minimum necessary for the timely and effective implementation of the verification provisions of this Convention; and (h) Access to confidential information shall be regulated in accordance with its classification. the dissemination of confidential information within the Organization shall be strictly on a need-to-know basis. 3. the Director-General shall report annually to the Conference on the implementation of the regime governing the handling of confidential information by the Technical Secretariat. 4.

They shall not communicate to any State, Organization or person outside the Technical Secretariat any information to which they have access in connection with their activities in relation to any State Party. 8. In the discharge of their functions inspectors shall only request the information and data which are necessary to fulfil their mandate. They shall not make any records of information collected incidentally and not related to verification of compliance with this Convention. 9. the staff shall enter into individual secrecy agreements with the Technical Secretariat covering their period of employment and a period of five years after it is terminated. 10. In order to avoid improper disclosures, inspectors and staff members shall be appropriately advised and reminded about security considerations and of the possible penalties that they would incur in the event of improper disclosure. 11. Not less than 30 days before an employee is given clearance for access to confidential information that refers to activities on the territory or in any other place under the jurisdiction or control of a State Party, the State Party concerned shall be notified of the proposed clearance. For inspectors the notification of a proposed designation shall fulfil this requirement. 12. In evaluating the performance of inspectors and any other employees of the Technical Secretariat, specific attention shall be given to the employee\\x92s record regarding protection of confidential information. C. Measures To Protect Sensitive Installations and Prevent Disclosure of Confidential Data In the Course of On-Site Verification Activities 13.

When receiving an inspection, the State Party may indicate to the inspection team the equipment, documentation or areas that it considers sensitive and not related to the purpose of the inspection. 14. Inspection teams shall be guided by the principle of conducting on-site inspections in the least intrusive manner possible consistent with the effective and timely accomplishment of their mission. They shall take into consideration proposals which may be made by the State Party receiving the inspection, at whatever stage of the inspection, to ensure that sensitive equipment or information, not related to chemical weapons, is protected. 15. Inspection teams shall strictly abide by the provisions set forth in the relevant Articles and Annexes governing the conduct of inspections. They shall fully respect the procedures designed to protect sensitive installations and to prevent the disclosure of confidential data. 16. In the elaboration of arrangements and facility agreements, due regard shall be paid to the requirement of protecting confidential information. Agreements on inspection procedures for individual facilities shall also include specific and detailed arrangements with regard to the determination of those areas of the facility to which inspectors are granted access, the storage of confidential information on-site, the scope of the inspection effort in agreed areas, the taking of samples and their analysis, the access to records and the use of instruments and continuous monitoring equipment. 17. the report to be prepared after each inspection shall only contain facts relevant to compliance with this Convention. the report shall be handled in accordance with the regulations established by the Organization governing the handling of confidential information. If necessary, the information contained in the report shall be processed into less sensitive forms before it is transmitted outside the Technical Secretariat and the inspected State Party. D. Procedures In Case of Breaches Or Alleged Breaches of Confidentiality 18. the Director-General shall establish necessary procedures to be followed in case of breaches or alleged breaches of confidentiality, taking into account recommendations to be considered and approved by the Conference pursuant to Article VIII, paragraph 21 (i). 19. the Director-General shall oversee the implementation of individual secrecy agreements. the Director-General shall promptly initiate an investigation if, in his judgment, there is sufficient indication that obligations concerning the protection of confidential information have been violated. the Director General shall also promptly initiate an investigation if an allegation concerning a breach of confidentiality is made by a State Party. 20. the Director-General shall impose appropriate punitive and disciplinary measures on staff members who have violated their obligations to protect confidential information. In cases of serious breaches, the immunity from jurisdiction may be waived by the Director-General. 21. States Parties shall, to the extent possible, cooperate and support the Director-General in investigating any breach or alleged breach of confidentiality and in taking appropriate action in case a breach has been established. 22. the Organization shall not be held liable for any breach of confidentiality committed by members of the Technical Secretariat. 23. For breaches involving both a State Party and the Organization, a \"Commission for the settlement of disputes related to confidentiality\", set up as a subsidiary organ of the Conference, shall consider the case. This Commission shall be appointed by the Conference. Rules governing its composition and operating procedures shall be adopted by the Conference at its first session.'},\n",

       "   'data': \"The Johannesburg Declaration On Sustainable Development 313. [4th September, 2002] From our Origins to the Future 1. We, the representatives of the peoples of the world, assembled at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa from 2-4 September 2002, reaffirm our commitment to sustainable development. 2. We commit ourselves to build a humane, equitable and caring global society cognisant of the need for human dignity for all. 3. At the beginning of this Summit, the children of the world spoke to us in a simple yet clear voice that the future belongs to them, and accordingly challenged all of us to ensure that through our actions they will inherit a world free of the indignity and indecency occasioned by poverty, environmental degradation and patterns of unsustainable development 4. As part of our response to these children, who represent our collective future, all of us, coming from every corner of the world, informed by different life experiences, are united and moved by a deeply-felt sense that we urgently need to create a new and brighter world of hope. 5. Accordingly, we assume a collective responsibility to advance and strengthen the interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars of sustainable development-economic development, social development and environmental protection-at local, national, regional and global levels. 6. From this Continent, the Cradle of Humanity we declare, through the Plan of Implementation and this Declaration, our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life and to our children. 7. Recognising that humankind is at a crossroad, we have united in a common resolve to make a determined effort to respond positively to the need to produce a practical and visible plan that should bring about poverty eradication and human development. From Stockholm to Rio de Janeiro to Johannesburg 8. Thirty years ago, in Stockholm, we agreed on the urgent need to respond to the problem of environmental deterioration. Ten years ago, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, we agreed that the protection of the environment, and social and economic development are fundamental to sustainable development, based on the Rio Principles. To achieve such development, we adopted the global programme, Agenda 21, and the Rio Declaration, to which we reaffirm our commitment. The Rio Summit was a significant milestone that set a new agenda for sustainable development. 9. Between Rio and Johannesburg the world's nations met in several major conferences under the guidance of the United Nations, including the Monterrey Conference on Finance for Development, as well as the Doha1. Vide World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002 at Johannesburg, South Africa, 4-9-2002 after review of 10 years progress of UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, 1992 Ministerial Conference. These conferences defined for the world a comprehensive vision for the future of humanity. 10. At the Johannesburg Summit we achieved much in bringing together a rich tapestry of peoples and views in a constructive search for a common path, towards a world that respects and implements the vision of sustainable development. Johannesburg also confirmed that significant progress has been made towards achieving a global consensus and partnership amongst all the people of our planet. The Challenges we Face 11. We recognise that poverty eradication, changing consumption and production patterns, and protecting and managing the natural resource base for economic and social development are overarching objectives of, and essential requirements for sustainable development. 12. The deep fault line that divides human society between the rich and the poor and the ever-increasing gap between the developed and developing worlds pose a major threat to global prosperity, security and stability. 13. The global environment continues to suffer. Loss of biodiversity continues, fish stocks continue to be depleted, desertification claims more and more fertile land, the adverse effects of climate change are already evident, natural disasters are more frequent and more devastating and developing countries more vulnerable, and air, water and marine pollution continue to rob millions of a decent life. 14. Globalisation has added a new dimension to these challenges. The rapid integration of markets, mobility of capital and significant increases in investment flows around the world have opened new challenges and opportunities for the pursuit of sustainable development. But the benefits and costs of globalisation are unevenly distributed, with developing countries facing special difficulties in meeting this challenge. 15. We risk the entrenchment of these global disparities and unless we act in a manner that fundamentally changes their lives, the poor of the world may lose confidence in their representatives and the democratic systems to which we remain committed, seeing their representatives as nothing more than sounding brass or tinkling cymbals. Our Commitment to Sustainable Development 16. We are determined to ensure that our rich diversity, which is our collective strength, will be used for constructive partnership for change and for the achievement of the common goal of sustainable development. 17. Recognising the importance of building human solidarity, we urge the promotion of dialogue and cooperation among the world's civilisations and peoples, irrespective of race, disabilities, religion, language, culture and tradition. 18. We welcome the Johannesburg Summit focus on the indivisibility of human dignity and are resolved through decisions on targets, timetables and partnerships to speedily increase access to basic requirements such as clean water, sanitation, adequate shelter, energy, health care, food security and the protection of biodiversity. At the same time, we will work together to assist one another to have access to financial resources, benefit from the opening markets, ensure capacity building, use modern technology to bring about development, and make sure that there is technology transfer, human resource development, education and training to banish forever underdevelopment. 19. We reaffirm our pledge to place particular focus on, and give priority attention to, the fight against the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people. Among these conditions are: chronic hunger; malnutrition; foreign occupation; armed conflicts; illicit drug problems; organised crime; corruption; natural disasters; illicit arms trafficking; trafficking in persons; terrorism; intolerance and incitement to racial, ethnic, religious and other hatreds; xenophobia; and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. 20. We are committed to ensure that women's empowerment and emancipation, and gender equality are integrated in all activities encompassed within Agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. 21. We recognise the reality that global society has the means and is endowed with the resources to address the challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development confronting all humanity. Together we will take extra steps to ensure that these available resources are used to the benefit of humanity. 22. In this regard, to contribute to the achievement of our development goals and targets, we urge developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the internationally agreed levels of Official Development Assistance. 23. We welcome and support the emergence of stronger regional groupings and alliances, such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), to promote regional cooperation, improved international co-operation and promote sustainable development. 24. We shall continue to pay special attention to the developmental needs of Small Island Developing States and the Least Developed Countries. 25. We reaffirm the vital role of the indigenous peoples in sustainable development. 26. We recognise sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As social partners we will continue to work for stable partnerships with all major groups respecting the independent, important roles of each of these. 27. We agree that in pursuit of their legitimate activities the private sector, both large and small companies, have a duty to contribute to the evolution of equitable and sustainable comrr}unities and societies. 28. We also agree to provide assistance to increase income generating employment opportunities, taking into account the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration of Fund4mental Principles and Rights at Work. 29. We agree that there is a need for private sector corporations to enforce corporate accountability. This should take place with a transparent and stable regulatory environment. 30. We undertake to strengthen and improve governance at all levels, for the effective implementation of Agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. Multilateralism is the Future 31. To achieve our goals of sustainable development, we need more effective, democratic and accountable international and multilateral institutions. 32. We reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter and international law as well as the strengthening of multi-lateralism. We support the leadership role of the United Nations as the most universal and representative organisation in the world, which is best placed to promote sustainable development. 33. We further commit ourselves to monitor progress at regular intervals towards the achievement of our sustainable development goals and objectives. Making it Happen! 34. We are in agreement that this must be an inclusive process, involving all the major groups and Governments that participated in the historic Johannesburg Summit. 35. We commit ourselves to act together, united by a common determination to save our planet, promote human development and achieve universal prosperity and peace. 36. We commit ourselves to the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and to expedite the achievement of the time-bound, socio-economic and environmental targets contained therein. 37. From the African continent, the Cradle of Humankind, we solemnly pledge to the peoples of the world, and the generations that will surely inherit this earth, that we are determined to ensure that our collective hope for sustainable development is realised. We express our deepest gratitude to the people and the Government of South Africa for their generous hospitality and excellent arrangements made for the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\"},\n",

If the Requested State reaches a decision at the same time on extradition to one of the Requesting States, and on re-extradition to another Requesting State, it shall communicate that decision on re-extradition to each of the Requesting States. Article 13 Decision 1. The Requested State shall promptly communicate to the Requesting State through diplomatic channels its decision on the request for extradition. 2. The Requested State shall convey to the Requesting State the reason for any complete or partial refusal of the request for extradition. Article 14 Postponed or Conditional Surrender 1. The Requested State may, after making its decision on the request for extradition, postpone the surrender of the person claimed in order that he may be proceeded against by that State or, if he has already been convicted in order that he may serve his sentence in the territory of that State for an offence other than that for which extradition is requested. 2. The Requested State may, instead of postponing surrender, temporarily surrender the person claimed to the Requesting State in accordance with conditions to be determined by mutual agreement between both States.

If extradition is agreed to, the Requesting State shall be informed of the place and date of surrender and of the length of time for which the person claimed was detained with a view to surrender. 2.

A request for consent shall be submitted, accompanied by the documents mentioned in Article 9 and a legal record of any statement made by the extradited person in respect of the offence concerned. Consent shall be given when the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to extradition in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; (b) When that person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which he has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of his final discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it. 2. The Requesting State may, however, take any measures necessary to remove the person from its territory, or any measures necessary under its law, including proceedings by default, to prevent any legal effects of lapse of time. 3. When the legal description of the offence for which a person has been extradited is altered this person shall only be proceeded against or sentenced if the offence under its new description: (a) can give rise to extradition pursuant to this Agreement; (b) relates to the same facts on which extradition was granted. 4. When the modification of the legal description of the offence for which a person has been extradited may result in a lessening of the sentence to be awarded, the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply. Article 17 Re-Extradition to a Third State Except as provided for in Article 16, paragraph 1(b), the Requesting State shall not, without the consent of the Requested State, surrender to a third State a person surrendered to it and sought by the said third State in respect of offences committed before his surrender. The Requested State may request the production of the documents mentioned in Article 9 as well as a legal record in which the person claimed states that he accepts or refuses re-extradition. Article 18 Information on the Result of the Criminal Proceedings The Requesting State shall inform the Requested State, upon demand by the latter, of the outcome of the criminal proceedings being conducted in respect of the extradited person and send a copy of the final and binding decision. Article 19 Surrender of Property 1.

Surrender of such articles shall be possible even without any special request and, if possible, at the same time as the person sought is surrendered. 2. The property specified in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be handed over even of extradition, having been agreed to, cannot be carried out owning to the death or escape of the person claimed. 3. Insofar as the rights of the Requested State or of third parties to the articles are to be respected, the Requested State may refuse surrender or condition surrender upon a satisfactory assurance from the Requesting State that the articles will be returned to the Requested State as soon as possible. Article 20 Transit 1. Transit through the territory of either of the Contracting States shall be granted upon request transmitted through the diplomatic channel, provided that the offence concerned is an extraditable offence under this Agreement. 2.

Irrespective of the place or places of commission of the extraditable offence the Requested Party shall grant extradition: a. When the person whose extradition is requested is a national of the Requesting Party; b. When the person sought is not a national of either Contracting Party, provided that the acts and omissions of the person sought amount to an offence affecting the interests of the Requesting Party or any of its nationals under the law of the Requested Party and the latter does not claim jurisdiction to prosecute for the same. Article 2 Extraditable Offences 1. Extradition shall be granted in respect of offences, which under the law of both Contracting Parties are punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment or other forms of deprivation of liberty for a minimum period of at least one year. In case extradition is requested for the purpose of serving one or more of punishments, extradition shall be granted if the aggregate term of the sentences, which remain to be served for one or more extraditable offences, is not less than six months. 2. If the request for extradition includes several separate offences, some of which do not fulfil the condition of para 1 with regard to the amount of punishment which may be awarded, extradition shall be granted for the offence, which meets the above specified conditions. This rule shall apply only to offences that meet the other conditions of this Treaty. 3.

The Preamble of the Convention is replaced by the following text: The States Parties To This Convention, Recognizing the right of all States to develop and apply nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and their legitimate interests in the potential benefits to be derived from the peaceful application of nuclear energy, Convinced of the need to facilitate international co-operation and the transfer of nuclear technology for the peaceful application of nuclear energy, Bearing in Mind that physical protection is of vital importance for the protection of public health, safety, the environment and national and international security, Having in Mind the purposes and principle\\'s of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of good neighborliness and friendly relations and co-operation among States, Considering that under the terms of paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, \"All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations,\" Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, annexed to General Assembly resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994, Desiring to avert the potential dangers posed by illicit trafficking, the unlawful taking and use of nuclear material and the sabotage of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, and noting that physical protection against such acts has become a matter of increased national and international concern, Deeply Concerned by the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and by the threats posed by international terrorism and organized crime, Believing that physical protection plays an important role in supporting nuclear non-proliferation and counter-terrorism objectives, Desiring through this Convention to contribute to strengthening worldwide the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities used for peaceful purposes, Convinced that offences relating to nuclear material and nuclear facilities are a matter of grave concern and that there is an urgent need to adopt appropriate and effective measures, or to strengthen existing measures, to ensure the prevention, detection and punishment of such offences, Desiring to strengthen further international co-operation to establish, in conformity with the national law of each State Party and with this Convention, effective measures for the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, Convinced that this Convention should complement the safe use, storage and transport of nuclear material and the safe operation of nuclear facilities, Recognizing that there are internationally formulated physical protection recommendations that are updated from time to time which can provide guidance on contemporary means of achieving effective levels of physical protection, Recognizing also that effective physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities used for military purposes is a responsibility of the State possessing such nuclear material and nuclear facilities, and understanding that such material and facilities are and will continue to be accorded stringent physical protection, Have Agreed as follows: 3. In Article 1 of the Convention, after paragraph (c), two new paragraphs are added as follows: (d) \"nuclear facility\" means a facility (including associated buildings and equipment) in which nuclear material is produced, processed, used, handled, stored or disposed of, if damage to or interference with such facility could lead to the release of significant amounts of radiation or radioactive material; (e) \"sabotage\" means any deliberate act directed against a nuclear facility or nuclear material in use, storage or transport which could directly or indirectly endanger the health and safety of personnel, the public or the environment by exposure to radiation or release of radioactive substances. 4. After Article 1 of the Convention, a new Article 1A is added as follows: The purposes of this Convention are to achieve and maintain worldwide effective physical protection of nuclear material used for peaceful purposes and of nuclear facilities used for peaceful purposes; to prevent and combat offences relating to such material and facilities worldwide; as well as to facilitate cooperation among States Parties to those ends. 5. Article 2 of the Convention - replaced by the following text: 1. This Convention shall apply to nuclear material used for peaceful purposes in use, storage and transport and to nuclear facilities used for peaceful purposes, provided, however, that articles 3 and 4 and paragraph 4 of article 5 of this Convention shall only apply to such nuclear material while in international nuclear transport. 2. The responsibility for the establishment, implementation and maintenance of a physical protection regime within a State Party rests entirely with that State. 3. Apart from the commitments expressly undertaken by States Parties under this Convention, nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as affecting the sovereign rights of a State. 4. (a) Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States Parties under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law. (b) The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, in as much as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention. (c) Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as a lawful\\' authorization to use or threaten to use force against nuclear material or nuclear facilities used for peaceful purposes. (d) Nothing in this Convention condones or makes lawful otherwise unlawful acts, nor precludes prosecution under other laws. 5. This Convention shall not apply to nuclear material used or retained for military purposes or to a nuclear facility containing such material. 6. After Article 2 of the Convention, a new Article 2A is added as follows: Article 2A 1. Each State Party shall establish, implement and maintain an appropriate physical protection regime applicable to nuclear material and nuclear facilities under its jurisdiction, with the aim of: (a) protecting against theft and other unlawful taking of nuclear material in, use, storage and transport; (b) ensuring the implementation of rapid and comprehensive measures to locate and, where appropriate, recover missing or stolen nuclear material; when the material is located outside its territory, that State Party shall act in accordance with article (c) protecting nuclear material and nuclear facilities against sabotage; and (d) mitigating or minimizing the radiological consequences of sabotage. 2. In implementing paragraph 1, each State Party shall: (a) establish and maintain a legislative and regulatory framework to govern physical protection; (b) establish or designate a competent authority or authorities responsible for the implementation of the legislative and regulatory framework; and (c) take other appropriate measures necessary for the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities. 3. In implementing the obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2, each State Party shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Convention, apply in so far as is reasonable and practicable the following Fundamental Principles of Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities. Fundamental Principle A: Responsibility of the State The responsibility for the establishment, implementation and maintenance of a physical protection regime within a State rests entirely with that State. Fundamental Principle B: Responsibilities During International Transport The responsibility of a State for ensuring that nuclear material is adequately protected extends to the international transport thereof, until that responsibility is properly transferred to another State, as appropriate. Fundamental Principle C: Legislative And Regulatory Framework The State is responsible for establishing and maintaining a legislative and regulatory framework to govern physical protection. This framework should provide for the establishment of applicable physical protection requirements and include a system of evaluation and licensing or other procedures to grant authorization. This framework should include a system of inspection of Nuclear facilities and transport to verify compliance with applicable requirements and conditions of the license or other authorizing document, and to establish a means to enforce applicable requirements and conditions, including effective sanctions. Fundamental Principle D: Competent Authority The State should establish or designate a competent authority which is responsible for the implementation of the legislative ami regulatory framework, and is provided with adequate authority, competence and financial and human - resources to fulfill its assigned responsibilities. The State should take steps to ensure an effective independence between the functions of the State\\'s competent authority and those or any other body in charge of the promotion or utilization of nuclear energy. Fundamental Principle E: Responsibility, of the License Holders The responsibilities for implementing the various elements of physical protection within a State should be clearly identified. The State should ensure that the prime responsibility for the implementation of physical protection of nuclear material or of nuclear facilities rests with the holders of the relevant licenses or of other authorizing documents (e.g., operators or shippers). Fundamental Principle F: Security Culture All organizations involved in implementing physical protection should give due priority, to the security culture, to its development and maintenance necessary to ensure its effective implementation in the entire organization. Fundamental Principle G: Threat The State\\'s physical protection should be based on the State\\'s current evaluation of the threat. Fundament Principle H: Graded Approach Physical protection requirements should be based on a graded approach, taking into account the current evaluation of the threat, the relative attractiveness, the nature of the material and potential consequences associated with the unauthorized removal of nuclear material and with the the sabotage against nuclear material or nuclear facilities. Fundament Principle I: Defence in Depth The State\\'s requirements for physical protection should reflect a concept of several layers and methods of protection (structural or other technical, personnel and organizational) that have to be or circumvented by an adversary, in order to achieve his objectives. Fundamental Principle J: Quality Assurance A quality assurance policy and quality assurance programmes should be established and implemented with a view to providing confidence that specified requirements for all activities important to physical protection are satisfied. Fundamental Principle K: Contingency Plans Contingency (emergency) plans to respond to unauthorized removal of nuclear material or sabotage of nuclear facilities or nuclear material or attempts thereof, should be prepared and appropriately exercised by all license holders and authorities concerned. Fundamental Principle L: Confidentiality The State should establish requirements for protecting the confidentiality of information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could compromise the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities. 4. (a) The provisions of this article shall not apply to any nuclear material which the State Party reasonably decides does not need to be subject to the physical protection regime established pursuant to paragraph 1, taking into account the nature of the material, its quantity and relative attractiveness and the potential radiological and other consequences associated with any unauthorized act directed against it and the current evaluation of the threat against it. (b) Nuclear material which is not subject to the provisions of this article pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) should be protected in accordance with prudent management practice. 7. Article 5 of the Convention is replaced by the following text: 1. States Parties shall identify and make known to each other directly or through the International Atomic Energy Agency their point of contact in relation to matters within the scope of this Convention. 2. In the case of theft, robbery or any other unlawful taking of nuclear material or credible threat thereof, States Parties shall, in accordance with their national law, provide co-operation and assistance to the maximum feasible extent in the recovery and protection of such material to any State that so requests. In particular: (a) a State Party shall take appropriate steps to inform as soon as possible other States, which appear to it to be concerned, of any theft, robbery or other unlawful taking of nuclear material or credible threat thereof, and to inform, where appropriate, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other relevant international organizations; (b) in doing so, as appropriate, the States Parties concerned shall exchange information with each other, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other relevant international organizations with a view to protecting threatened nuclear material, verifying the integrity of the shipping container or recovering unlawfully taken nuclear material and shall: (i) co-ordinate their efforts through diplomatic and other agreed channels; (ii) render assistance, if requested; (iii) ensure the return of recovered nuclear material stolen or missing as a consequence of the above-mentioned events.

Have Agreed as follows: Article 1 Obligation To Extradite Each Contracting State agrees to extradite to the other, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, any person who are wanted for trial, or the imposition or enforcement of a sentence, in the Requesting State for an extraditable offence. Article 2 Extraditable Offences 1. For the purposes of this Treaty, extraditable offences are offences, however described, which are punishable under the laws of both Contracting States by imprisonment for a maximum period of at least one year or by a more severe penalty. Where the request for extradition relates to a person convicted of such an offence who is wanted for the enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment, extradition shall be granted only if a period of at least six months of such penalty remains to be served. 2. For the purpose of this Article, in determining whether an offence is an offence against the law of both Contracting States: (a) it shall not matter whether the laws of the Contracting States place the acts or omissions constituting the offence within the same category of offence or denominate the offence by the same terminology; and (b) the totality of the acts or omissions alleged against the person whose extradition is sought shall he taken into account and it shall not matter whether, under the laws of the Contracting States, the constituent elements of the offence differ. 3. An offence may be an extraditable offence notwithstanding that it relates to taxation, customs duties, foreign exchange control or other revenue matters, or is one of a purely fiscal character. Extradition may not be refused on the ground that the law of the Requested State does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain a tax, duty, customs, or exchange regulation of the same kind as the law of the Requesting State. 4. Where the offence has been committed outside the territory of the Requesting State, extradition shall be granted if the law of the Requested State provides for the punishment of an offence committed outside its territory in similar circumstances. Where the law of the Requested State does not so provide the Requested State may, in its discretion, grant extradition. 5. Extradition shall be granted pursuant to the provisions of this Treaty irrespective of whether the offence for which extradition is sought was committed before or after entry into force of this Treaty, provided in all cases that (a) it was an offence in the Requesting State at the time of the acts or omissions constituting the offence are alleged to have occurred; and (b) the acts or omissions alleged would, if they had taken place in the territory of the Requested State at the time of the making of the request for extradition, have constituted an offence against the law in force in that State. Article 3 Composite Offences Extradition shall also be available in accordance with this Treaty for an extraditable offence, notwithstanding that the conduct of the person sought occurred wholly or in part in the Requested State, if under the law of that State this conduct and its effects, or its intended effects, taken as a whole, would be regarded as constituting the commission of an extraditable offence in the territory of the Requesting State. Article 4 Grounds of Refusal 1. Extradition shall not be granted if: (a) the offence of which a person is accused or convicted is a military offence which is not also an offence under the general criminal law; (b) If the person whose extradition is sought has, according to the law of the Requesting State, become immune from prosecution of punishment by reason of lapse of time; (c) if the offence with which the person sought is accused or convicted or any other offence for which that person may be detained or tried in accordance with this Treaty, carries the death penalty under the law of the Requesting State, unless the extradition request includes an undertaking that the death penalty will not be imposed or, if imposed, will not be carried out. 2. Extradition may be refused if the offence of which it is requested is an offence of a political character. For the purposes of this Treaty the following offences shall not be regarded as offences of a political character: (a) an offence in respect of which the Contracting States have an obligation to extradite or submit the case to their competent authorities for prosecution, under a multilateral/international treaty or convention to which both Contracting States are parties; (b) an offence in respect of the taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State, Head of Government, or a member of that person's family; (c) murder, culpable homicide or manslaughter; (d) an offence, involving firearms, explosives, incendiaries, destructive devices or substances, causing death, grievous bodily harm of serious damage to property; (e) any other offence related to terrorism which at the time of the request is, under the law of the Requested State, not to be regarded as an offence of a political character; or (f) conspiracy or attempt to commit, or participation in, or abetment of, any of the foregoing offences. 3. Extradition may be refused in any of the following circumstances: (a) if the person has been tried and finally dealt with in respect of the offence for which extradition is sought; (b) if the Requested State has substantial grounds to believe that the request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, sex, religion, nationality or political opinion or that the person's position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons; (c) if the person whose extradition is requested has been sentenced or would be liable to be tried or sentenced in the Requesting State by an extraordinary or ad hoc court or tribunal; (d) if the Requested State believes that the surrender is likely to have exceptionally serious consequences for the person whose extradition is sought, including because of the person's age or state of health. Article 5 Extradition of Nationals The nationals of one Contracting State may be extradited to the other Contracting State. If extradition is not granted, the Requested State shall, on the request of the Requesting State, submit the case to its competent authorities for prosecution in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty and the laws of the Requested State. Article 6 Extradition and Prosecution 1. The request for extradition may be refused by the Requested State if the person whose extradition is sought may be tried for the extradition offence in the courts of that State. 2. Where the Requested State refuses a request for extradition for the reason set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall submit the case to its competent authorities so that prosecution may be considered.

If the request relates to an accused person, it must also be accompanied by a warrant of arrest, or a copy thereof, issued by a Judge, Magistrate, or other competent authority in the territory of the Requesting State and such documents or other information required by the Requesting State as would reasonably establish that the person sought has committed the offence for which extradition is requested and to establish that the person requested is the person to whom the warrant refers. 5. If the request relates to a person already convicted and sentenced, it shall also be accompanied by: (a) a certificate of conviction and sentence; and (b) a statement that the sentence is enforceable and how much of the sentence remains to be served. 6. If the Requested State considers that the documents or other information supplied for the purposes of this Treaty are not sufficient in order to enable a decision to be taken as to the request, additional documents or other information shall be submitted within such time as the Requested State may require. 7. If in any particular case the Requested State so requires, the Requesting State shall supply a translation of any document submitted in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty.

The application for provisional arrest shall contain; (a) a description of the person sought; (b) the location of the person sought, if known; (c) a brief statement of the facts of the case, including, if possible, the time and location of the offence; (d) a description of the laws violated; (e) a statement of the existence of a warrant of arrest, or a finding of guilt or judgment of conviction against the person sought; and (f) a statement that a request for extradition for the person sought will follow. 3. The Requesting State shall be notified without delay of the action taken on its application and the reasons for any denial. 4. A person who is provisionally arrested may be released from custody on the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date of provisional arrest pursuant to this Treaty if the executive authority of the Requested State has not received the formal request for extradition and the supporting documents required in Article 7. 5. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article shall not prejudice the subsequent re-arrest and extradition of that person, if the extradition request and supporting documents are delivered at a later date. Article 11 Concurrent Requests 1. Where requests are received from two or more States for the extradition of the same person, the Requested State shall determine to which of those States the person is to be extradited and shall notify the Requesting States of its decision. 2.

The two Contracting States shall agree upon a new date of surrender, and the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article shall apply. Article 13 Surrender of Property 1. To the extent permitted under the law of the Requested State all property found in the Requested State that has been acquired as a result of the offence or may be required as evidence shall be surrendered if extradition is granted and the Requesting State so requests. 2.

A person extradited under this Treaty may not be extradited to a third State for an offence committed prior to his extradition unless the Requested State consents. 3.

A request for the consent of the Requesting State under the present Article shall be accompanied by such of the documents as mentioned in Article 7 of the present Treaty as may be sought by the Requesting State.

Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Treaty: (a) \"works\" means literary and artistic works within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, in the form of text, notation and/or related illustrations, whether published or otherwise made publicly available in any media [1] ; (b) \"accessible format copy\" means a copy of a work in an alternative manner or form which gives a beneficiary person access to the work, including to permit the person to have access as feasibly and comfortably as a person without visual impairment or other print disability. The accessible format copy is used exclusively by beneficiary persons and it must respect the integrity of the original work, taking due consideration of the changes needed to make the work accessible in the alternative format and of the accessibility needs of the beneficiary persons; (c) \"authorized entity\" means an entity that is authorized or recognized by the government to provide education, instructional training, adaptive reading or information access to beneficiary persons on a non-profit basis. It also includes a government institution or non-profit organization that provides the same services to beneficiary persons as one of its primary activities or institutional obligations [2] . An authorized entity establishes and follows its own practices: (i) to establish that the persons it serves are beneficiary persons; (ii) to limit to beneficiary persons and/or authorized entities its distribution and making available of accessible format copies; (iii) to discourage the reproduction, distribution and making available of unauthorized copies; and (iv) to maintain due care in, and records of, its handling of copies of works, while respecting the privacy of beneficiary persons in accordance with Article 8. Article 3 Beneficiary Persons A beneficiary person is a person who: (a) is blind; (b) has a visual impairment or a perceptual or reading disability which cannot be improved to give visual function substantially equivalent to that of a person who has no such impairment or disability and so is unable to read printed works to substantially the same degree as a person without an impairment or disability; or [3] (c) is otherwise unable, through physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book or to focus or move the eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading; regardless of any other disabilities. Article 4National Law Limitations and Exceptions Regarding Accessible Format Copies 1. (a) Contracting Parties shall provide in their national copyright laws for a limitation or exception to the right of reproduction, the right of distribution, and the right of making available to the public as provided by the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT), to facilitate the availability of works in accessible format copies for beneficiary persons. The limitation or exception provided in national law should permit changes needed to make the work accessible in the alternative format. (b) Contracting Parties may also provide a limitation or exception to the right of public performance to facilitate access to works for beneficiary persons. 2. A Contracting Party may fulfill Article 4(1) for all rights identified therein by providing a limitation or exception in its national copyright law such that: (a) Authorized entities shall be permitted, without the authorization of the copyright rightholder, to make an accessible format copy of a work, obtain from another authorized entity an accessible format copy, and supply those copies to beneficiary persons by any means, including by non-commercial lending or by electronic communication by wire or wireless means, and undertake any intermediate steps to achieve those objectives, when all of the following conditions are met: (i) the authorized entity wishing to undertake said activity has lawful access to that work or a copy of that work; (ii) the work is converted to an accessible format copy, which may include any means needed to navigate information in the accessible format, but does not introduce changes other than those needed to make the work accessible to the beneficiary person; (iii) such accessible format copies are supplied exclusively to be used by beneficiary persons; and (iv) the activity is undertaken on a non-profit basis; and (b) A beneficiary person, or someone acting on his or her behalf including a primary caretaker or caregiver, may make an accessible format copy of a work for the personal use of the beneficiary person or otherwise may assist the beneficiary person to make and use accessible format copies where the beneficiary person has lawful access to that work or a copy of that work. 3. A Contracting Party may fulfill Article 4(1) by providing other limitations or exceptions in its national copyright law pursuant to Articles 10 and 11 [4] . 4. A Contracting Party may confine limitations or exceptions under this Article to works which, in the particular accessible format, cannot be obtained commercially under reasonable terms for beneficiary persons in that market. Any Contracting Party availing itself of this possibility shall so declare in a notification deposited with the Director General of WIPO at the time of ratification of, acceptance of or accession to this Treaty or at any time thereafter [5] . 5. It shall be a matter for national law to determine whether limitations or exceptions under this Article are subject to remuneration. Article 5Cross-Border Exchange of Accessible Format Copies 1.

A Contracting Party may fulfill Article 5(1) by providing other limitations or exceptions in its national copyright law pursuant to Articles 5(4), 10 and 11. 4. (a) When an authorized entity in a Contracting Party receives accessible format copies pursuant to Article 5(1) and that Contracting Party does not have obligations under Article 9 of the Berne Convention, it will ensure, consistent with its own legal system and practices, that the accessible format copies are only reproduced, distributed or made available for the benefit of beneficiary persons in that Contracting Party’s jurisdiction. (b) The distribution and making available of accessible format copies by an authorized entity pursuant to Article 5(1) shall be limited to that jurisdiction unless the Contracting Party is a Party to the WIPO Copyright Treaty or otherwise limits limitations and exceptions implementing this Treaty to the right of distribution and the right of making available to the public to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder [8] , [9] .

Article7Obligations Concerning Technological Measures Contracting Parties shall take appropriate measures, as necessary, to ensure that when they provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures, this legal protection does not prevent beneficiary persons from enjoying the limitations and exceptions provided for in this Treaty [11] . Article 8Respect for Privacy In the implementation of the limitations and exceptions provided for in this Treaty, Contracting Parties shall endeavor to protect the privacy of beneficiary persons on an equal basis with others. Article 9Cooperation to Facilitate Cross-Border Exchange 1.

When a tax claim of a Contracting Party is enforceable under the laws of that Party and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that Party prevent its collection, that tax claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that Party, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting Party. That tax claim shall be collected by that other Party in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the tax claim were a tax claim of that other Party. 4. When a tax claim of a Contracting Party is a claim in respect of which that Party may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that tax claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that Party, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting Party. That other Party shall take measures of conservancy in respect of mat tax claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the tax claim were a tax claim of that other Party even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the tax claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned Party or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 5. When a Contracting Party, under its law, takes interim measures of conservancy by freezing of assets before a tax claim is raised against a person, the competent authority of the other Contracting Party if requested by the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting Party shall take measures for freezing the assets of that person in that Contracting Party in accordance with the provisions of its law. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a tax claim accepted by a Contracting Party for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that Party, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a tax claim under the laws of that Party by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a tax claim accepted by a Contracting Party for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that Party, have any priority applicable to that tax claim under the laws of the other Contracting Party. 7. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a tax claim of a Contracting Party shall only be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of that Party. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as creating or providing any right to such proceedings before any court or administrative body of the other Contracting Party. 8. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting Party under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting Party has collected and remitted the relevant tax claim to the first mentioned Party, the relevant tax claim ceases to be: (a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a tax claim of the first-mentioned Party that is enforceable under the laws of that Party and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that Party, prevent its collection, or (b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a tax claim of the first-mentioned Party in respect of which that Party may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, the competent authority of the first-mentioned Party shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other Party of that fact and, at the option of the other Party, the first-mentioned Party shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 9. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting Party the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting Party; (b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); (c) to provide assistant if the other Contracting Party has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that Party is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting Party. 10. The competent authority that submits a request of assistance in the collection of tax claims shall provide the following information: the identity of the person about whom assistance is requested, the nature of the tax claim, the constituting elements of such claims, and the assets which can be used for collection. 11.
