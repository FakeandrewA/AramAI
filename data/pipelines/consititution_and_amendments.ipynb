In simple words, the people of Sikkim wanted to fill the gap between them and India and thus demanded the special status of an associate state. The Amendment observed the insertion of Article 2A in the constitution. Article 2A stated that Sikkim was associated with the Union while the tenth schedule emphasizes the special conditions of association between the Union and Sikkim. It gives the Sikkim people the right to represent themselves in the Legislative Assembly and various political institutions. This amendment inculcated among the people a sense of belongingness and equal rights as any other citizen.Important Verdicts- State of Sikkim vs Surendra Prasad Sharma Also Refer ] [ Editorial Comment - The Constitution (Thirty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 1975,Remove article 2A:Formation of Sikkim as a State within the Indian Union.

Originally, Article 3, did not prescribe a time limit for expression of views by the States on the States reorganization laws. It was feared that the States could forestall the passage of the State Reorganisation Act by not expressing their views for any length of time. The amended Article now provides a time limit within which the State has to express their views. If they do not express their views within the specified time the Bill may be passed by Parliament.

Explanation II.- The power conferred on Parliament by clause (a) includes the power to form a new State or Union territory by uniting a part of any State or Union territory to any other State or Union territory. [ Editorial Comment - The Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 1966, revised Article 3 of the Constitution to give new meaning to the terms “State” and “Union territories”. The modification clarified that in Article 3, the term “State” in clauses (a) to (e) must include “Union territories”. However, this was not applicable in the proviso. It further explained that the power under clause (a) involves the authority of the Parliament for the formation of a new State or Union territory. This may be done by joining a part of any State or Union territory with some other State or Union territory. Also refer ] 4.

Part III – Fundamental Rights 12. Definition In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, \"the State\" includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. Editorial Comment - This article provides the definition of the “state” in India and the various organs which come under it. This definition of the State under Article 12 is applicable only for Part 3 (Fundamental Rights) and Part 4 (Directive Principles of State Policy) of the Constitution of India. The meaning of “Other Authorities” under Article 12 can be understood by looking at leading case laws such as In the case of Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Mohanlal, AIR 1967 wherein it was decided that “other authorities is wide enough to include within it every authority created by a statute on which powers are conferred to carry out governmental or quasi-governmental functions and functioning within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.” The court further laid down the guidelines for deciding ‘any authority’ as ‘Other Authority’ under Article 12, \\u200bIn the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport (1979): “If the entire shares are owned by the Government, “If almost the entire expenditure is done by the Government”, “If there is a state conferred monopoly in that corporation”, “Whenever there is deep and pervasive control by the Government” and “If the functions by the corporation are of Public importance” and lastly, “If a department of the Government is transferred to a corporation.” Indian Courts have interpreted the meaning of \\'State\\' in various contexts over time to extend the dimension of Fundamental Rights. In the case of University of Madras v. Santa Bai , the Madras High Court evolved the principle of ejusdem generis i.e. of the “like nature”. It means that those authorities are covered under the expression \\'other authorities’ which perform governmental or sovereign functions. In Sukhdev v. Bhagatram, LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) , ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) and IFC (International Finance Corporation) were held to be state as they perform very similar functions which seem to be governmental or sovereign functions. Another set of discussions have been around the fact of the Judiciary becoming part of the state. Eminent Jurists like H.M.Seervai, V.N.Shukla consider judiciary to be State. Their view is supported by Articles 145 and 146 of the Constitution of India. “It was held that the Supreme Court is empowered to make rules for regulating the practice and procedure of Courts and is also empowered to make appointments of its staff and servants and decide its service conditions.” In Prem Garg v. Excise Commissioner H.P. The Supreme Court held that when rule making power of the judiciary is concerned, it is ‘state’. There have been contrary opinions on this subject too. In Rati Lal v. State of Bombay , it was held that the judiciary is not state for the purpose of Article 12. In A.R.Antulay v. R.S.Nayak and N.S.Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra , it has been observed that “when rule making power of judiciary is concerned it is state but when exercise of judicial power is concerned it is not state.” Thus, the word \\'state\\' under Article 12 jurisprudence has evolved in India through various interpretations and discussions in the High courts and the Supreme court. It has been given a wider meaning which ensures that Part-III of the constitution can be applied to a larger extent.

Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights (1) All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Pan, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void. (2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void. (3) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,- (a) \"law\" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law; (b) \"laws in force\" includes laws passed or made by Legislature or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed, notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas. (4) Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under article 368. [ Editorial comment - \\u200bArticle 13 (1) discusses the laws which were made before the commencement of the Constitution (26 January 1950) and Article 13 (2) delves about the laws which are made after the Constitution is in place. \\u200bArticle 13 (1) states that all the laws which are made before the Constitution will be void as long as they are violating the provisions of the Fundamental Rights. It further states that only that part of the law which will be void which is against the provisions of the constitution and not the whole law itself. This guarantee is against the existing laws and future laws and not to the laws which are made before the commencement of the constitution. \\u200bArticle 13(2) states that all the laws which are made after the commencement of the Constitution are void to the extent of the infringement of the Fundamental Rights given in part 3 of the Constitution. The ‘Doctrine of Eclipse’ asserts that all the Pre-Constitutional laws which are against the fundamental rights of the Indian Constitution will become dormant and not dead. They will remain dormant as long as the state does not amend the law and its infringing nature. So this doctrine applies to only Article 13(1) of the Indian Constitution. In Keshavan Madhvan Menon v. State of Bombay , the court said that the law which is infringing the rights of the citizens after the commencement of the constitution is ‘void ab initio’ for the citizens of the country but it will remain enforceable for the non-citizens and companies. The doctrine of Eclipse makes the law unenforceable but it doesn’t make the law void ab initio. The ‘doctrine of Waiver’ means that a person who is receiving a right or a privilege can waive that right according to his will. Once the right is waived by the individual then they cannot claim it back. In Behram v. State of Bombay , it was decided by the court that the rights which are given in part 3 of the constitution cannot be waived by an individual. The ‘Doctrine of Separability’ means that if a part of a law is against the provisions of the constitution then only that offending part will be declared as void and not the whole statute. This doctrine is applied in both Article 13 (1) and Article 13 (2) of the Indian Constitution. In R.M.D.C. v. Union of India , AIR 1957, Supreme Court has given some rules relating to this doctrine: “1. It is important to understand the intention of the legislature before using this doctrine. 2. When separation of invalid part of the statute is very difficult then the whole law will be held as invalid. 3. If after deleting the invalid part, the valid part has no value left to it then the whole act will be rejected in its entirety.” Article 13(3) (a) defines “Law”. According to this section, Law includes any ordinance, order, bye-Law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usages. This definition of law is given a wide meaning so that it can be added to a wide variety of state instrumentalities. In Ahmedabad Women Action Group v. Union of India , AIR 1977, Supreme Court said that personal laws (Hindu Law, Muslim Law, and Christian Law) are not part of the definition of Law under Article 13. The Bye-Laws made by the Cooperative Societies are also not part of the definition of Law. There have also been other discussions on whether “Law” includes constitutional amendments. \\u200bThis question was first decided in the case of Shankari Prasad v. Union of India AIR 1951. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the word law under Article 13(2) doesn’t include a constitutional amendment. This entailed that the Parliament has power to amend the Fundamental Rights according to their will. \\u200bLater in the case of Golak Nath v. State of Punjab , AIR 1967, the Supreme Court overruled the Shankari Prasad verdict and stated that the word ‘Law’ in Article 13(2) includes the constitutional amendments. If any constitutional amendment is infringing the Fundamental rights then that amendment will be void. \\u200bTo nullify the Golak Nath decision the Parliament passed the 24th Amendment Act, 1971, wherein parliament added Clause 4 in Article 13 which stated that nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368. \\u200bLater in the case of the Kesavananda Bharati v. the State of Kerala, AIR 1973, the constitutionality of the 24th Amendment was held valid. So the present position of the word “Law” is that a Constitutional Amendment does not include the word. This gives the Parliament the power to amend the provisions of the Fundamental rights as long as they align with the basic structure doctrine of the Indian Constitution.

Golaknath and Ors. vs State of Punjab and Anrs. The Supreme Court delivered its ruling, by a majority of 6-5 on 27 February 1967. The Court held that an amendment of the Constitution is a legislative process, and that an amendment under article 368 is \"law\" within the meaning of article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment \"takes away or abridges\" a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. Article 13(2) reads, \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of contravention, be void.\" The Court also ruled that Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution are given a \"transcendental position\" under the Constitution and are kept beyond the reach of Parliament.

Equality before law The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Editorial Comment -Article 14 rejects any type of discrimination based on caste, race, and religion, place of birth or sex. This Article is having a wide ambit and applicability to safeguard the rights of people residing in India. This article is divided into two parts: Equality before the Law: This part of the article indicates that all are to be treated equally in the eyes of the law. This is a negative concept as it implies the absence of any privilege in favor of any person. This is a substantive part of the article. Equal protection of the Laws: This part means that the same law will be applied to all the people equally across the society. This is a positive concept as it expects a positive action from the state. This is a procedural part of article 14. “The dissent of Justice Subba Rao in the State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya 1960 stated that Article 14 comprises both “positive content” as well as “negative content”. Whereas, equality before the law is a negative content, equal protection of the laws exhibits a positive content of Article 14.” The doctrine of Anti Arbitrariness:  The scope of article 14 was drastically increased by the Supreme Court by including the executive discretion under its ambit. In the case of E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu , 1974, the court said that Article 14 gives a guarantee against the arbitrary actions of the State. The Right to Equality is against arbitrariness. They both are enemies to each other. So it is important to protect the laws from the arbitrary actions of the Executive. “The first landmark judgment which actually spotted the virtue of non-arbitrariness in Article 14 was S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India . The Court, for the first time held “absence of arbitrary power” as sine qua non to rule of law with confined and defined discretion, both of which are essential facets of Article 14.” In here Justice Subba Rao elaborating on the wide expanse of Article 14 , vide para 14 held thus: “In this context it is important to emphasize that the absence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional system is based. In a system governed by rule of law, discretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must be confined within clearly defined limits.” In the Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 1978, \\xa0Justice Bhagwati said that Equality is against the arbitrariness of State action. So this doctrine ensures equality of treatment. “The seven-Judge Bench held that a trinity exists between Article 14, Article 19 and Article 21. All these articles have to be read together. Any law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple test: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must withstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article 14.” Natural Justice as a part of Article 14: From the case of A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India , It is evident that Natural Justice (natural justice is technical terminology for the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem)) is an integral part of Article 14. \\xa0The court held that “the Principle of Natural Justice helps in the prevention of miscarriage of Justice, These Principles also check the arbitrary power of the State.” Classification Test: In the case of Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar, 1958 the Supreme Court describes the jurisprudence of equality before the law. It simply permits the State to make differential classification of subjects (which would otherwise be prohibited by Article 14) provided that the classification is founded on intelligible differentia (i.e. objects within the class are clearly distinguishable from those that are outside) and has a rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved by the classification. In the case of Indra Sawhney v UOI, 1993 which is a landmark judgment on aspects of reservation in India. “The Court interpreted the relation between Article 14 and Article 16. It was held that Article 16(1) is a facet of Article 14. Just as Article 14 permits reasonable classification, so does Article 16(1). A classification may involve reservation of seats or vacancies. The principle aims of Article 14 and 16 is equality and equality of opportunity and Clause (4) of Article 16 is a means of achieving the very same objective. Both the provisions have to be harmonized keeping in mind the fact that both are the restatements of the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14.” Further expansion of Article 14 was done in the case of Visakha v State of Rajasthan, 1997 “The judgment sought to enforce the fundamental rights of working women under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Sexual Harassment violates the fundamental right of the women of gender equality which is codified under Article 14 of Indian Constitution and also the fundamental right to life and to live a dignified life. The Court held that even though there is no express provision for sexual harassment at workplace under Indian Constitution, it is implicit through these fundamental rights.” (references mentioned below) Expansion of Article 14 in terms of defining Gender: In the case of National Legal Service Authority [NALSA] v UOI, 2014 . “This case was filed by the National Legal Services Authority of India (NALSA) to legally recognize persons who fall outside the male/female gender binary, including persons who identify as “third gender”. While drawing attention to the fact that transgender persons were subject to “extreme discrimination in all spheres of society”, the Court held that the right to equality (Article 14 of the Constitution) was framed in gender-neutral terms (“all persons”). Consequently, the right to equality would extend to transgender persons also.” Further in Shayara Bano v UOI, 2016 “the 5 Judge Bench of the Supreme Court pronounced its decision in the Triple Talaq Case, declaring that the practice of instantaneous triple talaq [Talaq-ul-biddat] was unconstitutional. The Bench observed that the fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution, manifested within its fold, equality of status. Gender equality, gender equity and gender justice are values intrinsically entwined in the guarantee of equality, under Article 14.” These above discussed landmark cases and many more have contributed to expand the ambit and scope of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, to strive for a more equal and fair society.

[ Editorial Comment - Article 15 protects the citizens against various forms of discrimination based on religion and gender. The Constitution of India guarantees various rights to its citizens, including no discrimination on account of religion, race, caste, or place of birth. Article 15 restricts discrimination on the ground of: Religion – It means that no person should be discriminated against on the basis of religion from accessing any public place or policy by the state or any group. Race – Ethnic origin should not form a basis of discrimination. For example, a citizen of Afghan origin should not be discriminated against those of an Indian origin. Caste – Discrimination on the basis of caste is also prohibited to prevent atrocities on the lower castes by the upper caste. Sex – Gender of an individual shall not be a valid ground for discrimination in any matter. Place of birth – A place where an individual is born should not become a reason for discriminating among other members of the country. In the case of Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra , the state of Saurashtra set up special courts under Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance 1949, to adjudicate on the matters of section 302 , section 307 and section 392 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The contention brought before the court was that these provisions are discriminatory for the residents depending upon the territory. The court stated that all kinds of legislative differentiation are not discriminatory. The legislation did not refer to certain individual cases but to offenses of certain kinds committed in certain areas and hence it is not discrimination. In another significant case, John Vallamattom v. Union of India, AIR 2003 SC 2902 discussed that The Indian Succession Act 1925 prevented the petitioners from bequeathing property for religious and charitable purposes. The petitioner contended it to be discriminatory against the testamentary dispositions by a Christian. The court stated that the Act was to prevent people from making injudicious death-bed bequests under religious influence, but had a great impact on a person desiring to dispose of his property upon his death. Hence, the legislation is clearly discriminatory as the properties of any Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain or Parsi were excluded from the provisions of the Act. Further, no acceptable reasoning was provided to show why the provision regulates religious and charitable bequests of Christians alone. Clause 1 of the Article prohibits the State from discriminating against citizens on five protected grounds only. This means that if the discrimination is only on the basis of these 5 points then it will be void. One of the important points to remember under this clause is that the prohibition is against the state and not against any private individuals.\\xa0This clause is used to give horizontal reservations like reservations for visually impaired people. The Supreme Court in D.P. Joshi v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1955 has made it clear that the place of birth and place of residence are two different things and States are allowed to differentiate on the basis of place of residence. In this case, the residents of the State were allowed exemption from paying the capitation fee. But the non-residents were asked to pay a capitation fee for admission in the medical college. This was held valid by the Supreme Court. Clause 2 discussed Access to Public Places. This clause gives access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment to all. This clause also makes wells, tanks, bathing Ghats, roads and places of public resort accessible for every citizen. This clause is applied not only to the state but also against the individuals. It is illegal and unjust to restrict or prevent access to a public place established by the state exclusively for public use. Clause 3 discusses Special Provision for Women and Children. This clause is an exception to clause 1 and 2. This clause provides special preference to Women and Children as a matter of positive discrimination. It entails that nothing in this Article can stop the state from giving special preference to the Women and Children. In Revathi v. Union of India, AIR 1998 case, the court held that the word ‘for’ which is given under this clause means that states can give special preference to Women and Children in legislation.Clause 4 discusses Special Provisions for Backward Classes. This is the second exception of clause 1 and 2 of Article 15. This clause was not part of the original Constitution and was included through the 1st Constitutional Amendment. This clause makes special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens (SEBCs), Schedule Caste (SC) and Schedule Tribes (STs).\\u200b In Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 , the government of Mysore set up a reservation of 68% of the total seats in Engineering and Medical colleges. These seats were reserved in the favor of SEBCs, STs and SCs. The court held that this legislation breached the limit of reservation which should not be more than 50% of the total seats. The court also stated that the backwardness must be both Social and Economical. It can’t be either social or economical alone. It was also held by the Supreme Court in A. Periakaruppan v. State of Tamil Nadu that classifying socially and educationally backward classes on the basis of caste was in violation of Article 15(4). According to the Court, it was, however, necessary for the conditions of such a class of people to change as that was the main reason for providing them with a reservation. Clause 5 discusses Reservation in Educational institutions. This is the 3rd Exception of Article 15. This exception was added by the 93rd Constitutional Amendment. This clause was added as a result of a Judgment of PA Inamdar and Ors. V. State of Maharashtra and Ors. In this judgment the court held that different states cannot impose its reservation policy on minority and non-minority unaided private colleges, including professional colleges. The validity of this act and 93rd Constitutional Amendment was challenged in Ashok Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (2008) Clause 6 lays down the Special Provisions for EWS category. This provision was added by the 103rd Constitutional amendment Act, 2019. This is the latest exception that provides for special provisions for the Economic Weaker Section (EWS). Several states have implemented schemes to enforce reservations for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) based on Clause (6). In 2021, the central government issued a notification to introduce EWS reservation in the medical postgraduate entrance exam. However, this decision was challenged in the Supreme Court.Multiple parties raised concerns about the constitutionality of the 103rd Amendment and brought the matter before the Supreme Court. They argued that it goes against the jurisprudence on reservations, which does not permit reservations solely based on economic criteria. On November 7, 2022, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India, in the case of Janhit Abhiyan v. Union of India, ruled that the 103rd Amendment does not violate the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Justices Maheshwari, Trivedi, and Pardiwala delivered separate judgments in favor of the majority, while Justice Bhat expressed a dissenting opinion on behalf of himself and Chief Justice U.U Lalit.

However, some states have chosen to implement the 10% reservation for economically weaker sections. Currently, the quota can be availed by persons with an annual gross household income of up to ₹8 lakh (US$10,000). Families that own over 5 acres of agricultural land, a house over 1,000 square feet, a plot of over 100-yards in a notified municipal area or over a 200-yards plot in a non-notified municipal area cannot avail the reservation.

[In article 16 of the Constitution after clause 4, the following clauses shall be inserted through Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995, broadened the reservation provisions for job promotions, encompassing individuals belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Since 1955, the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) have had access to the facility of reservation in the promotion. However, the Supreme Court stated in its decision dated November 16, 1992, in the issue of Indra Sawhney and Others vs. Union of India and Others that reservation of appointments or posts under Article 16(4) of the Constitution is restricted to initial appointment. Further, it cannot extend to a reservation in matters of promotion. The interests of the SC and STs will be harmed by this Supreme Court decision. It is vital to continue the current dispensation of offering reservations in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes since their representation in services in the States has not achieved the requisite level. The government has chosen to maintain the prevailing policy of reservations in the promotion of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in light of its commitment to safeguarding the interests of these groups. To achieve this, it is necessary to change Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. This is accomplished by adding a new clause (4A) to the aforementioned article that establishes a reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).

This gave the states the authority to treat unfilled reserved vacancies from one year as a separate class of vacancies to be filled in the following year or years. The new provision stated that such vacancies must not be included in the vacancies of the year in which they are filled, in order to calculate the overall vacancy reservation ceiling of 50% for that year.

Editorial Comment - Article 16 discusses equality in opportunity of employment for all the citizens. There are 6 Clauses under this article. Starting clause 1 and 2 talks about equality of Opportunity and clause 3 to 6 are the exceptions of clause 1 and 2. Clause 1 states that there shall be equal opportunity for the citizens in the matter of employment or appointment to any office under the State. This clause does not provide the right to employment; it only gives the right to equal opportunity in case of any available vacancy in public employment. This clause also applies to promotions or termination and other aspects of state employment. This equality is applied only to the people who are applying for the same employment opportunity or are working in the same post. Clause 2 states that there will be no discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence in employment. The state cannot discriminate only on the basis of the above criterias. It is stated in clause 3 of Article 16 that nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law which prescribes to the citizens who are appointed to any office under the State in regard to any requirements as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to employment or appointment to any office under the State. Article 16(4) of the Indian constitution provides for the reservation of services under the State in favor of the backward class of citizens. Backward class includes Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes. In the case of Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 the court held that caste cannot be the sole determining criteria for gauging the backwardness of a community. It can be their Poverty or the place where they live also. In the case of T. Devadashan v. Union of India, AIR 1964 , the court struck down the carry forward rule for the vacancies of backward classes. The Court held that, following Balaji, the reserve vacancies in any one year had risen to more than 50% because they were not constitutional because of the carry-forward clause. The 50% rule only applies to proper reservations, i.e., backward classes reservations made under Article 16(4). The law cannot be applied to exemptions, concessions, or reliefs given to retroactive classes in compliance with Article 16(4). In the landmark judgment, Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, AIR 1993 (Mandal case), the Supreme Court dealt with the issue of “carry forward” reservations. The Second Backward Classes Committee, headed by BP Mandal, submitted its report which recommended 27 percent reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and 22.5 percent for the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. The Central government, however, acted on the report a decade later, by issuing an office memorandum (OM), providing 27 percent vacancies for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes to be filled by direct recruitment. Indra Sawhney, the petitioner in this case, made three principal arguments against the Order- The extension of reservation violated the Constitutional guarantee of equality of opportunity, caste was not a reliable indicator of backwardness and that the efficiency of public institutions was at risk. The Supreme Court upheld the government order that caste was an acceptable indicator of backwardness. Thus, the recommendation of reservations for OBCs in central government services was finally implemented in 1992. The Supreme Court states that 27% central government reservation for OBCs is valid. However, some states denied the existence of the creamy layer, and a report commissioned by the supreme court was implemented. The case was pressed again in 1999 and the supreme court reaffirmed the creamy layer exclusion and extended it to SCs and STs. This judgment also overruled Rangachar v. General Manager Southern Railway and Akhil Bharatiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh (Railway) v. Union of India verdicts, which said that reservations could be made in promotions as well as appointments. Indra Sawhney v. Union of India held that reservations cannot be applied in promotions. Later, the Parliament enacted the 77th Amendment Act, 1995 and added clause (4A) to Article 16 of the Constitution, thereby enabling the Parliament to make provisions for reservation for SCs and STs in promotion posts. This simply meant that even after the judgment of mandal case, the reservation in promotion in government jobs, shall continue. Clause (4B) was added to the Indian Constitution by way of 81st Amendment Act, 2000. It was added to the Constitution with the intent that the backlog vacancies which could not be filled due to unavailability of eligible candidates of the SEBC category in a previous or preceding year, shall not be clubbed with the 50 percent reservation for the SCs and STs and Other Backward Classes on the total number of vacancies in the next year. Clause (5) exempts a law from the application of clauses (1) and (2), which require the incumbent of any office to be religiously qualified for appointment. The case M. Nagaraj v. Union of India dealt with Articles 16 (4A) and (4B) of the Constitution. It was held in this case that in order to grant reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the State must collect ‘quantifiable data’ to demonstrate their backwardness. It was held that the concept of the creamy layer will also apply to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and therefore, they would not be entitled to any such reservations. Further, the decision was altered as it was argued by the Attorney-General of India that both the holdings were incorrect as they were contrary to the judgment which was given in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (non-exclusion of creamy layer in matters of reservations). Clause (6) was added to Article 16 by the 103rd Amendment Act, 2019, which came into effect on January 14, 2019, and empowers the State to make various provisions for reservation in appointments of members of the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of society to government posts. However, these provisions must be within the 10% ceiling, in addition to the existing reservations. In the case of Janhit Abhiyan v. Union of India (2022) the constitutionality of the 103rd Amendment was contested, alleging that it violated the fundamental structure of the Indian Constitution. However, the majority decision, with a 3:2 ratio, upheld the amendment as constitutionally valid. Justice Maheshwari explained that reservations go beyond being mere affirmative actions or measures to address social and educational backwardness; instead, they serve to combat various forms of disadvantages. The majority also ruled that a 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in addition to the existing 50% reservation limit, as established in the Indra Sawhney Case, is constitutional. Additionally, all three judges agreed that the 50% limit is not rigid and may be surpassed in exceptional circumstances. References Social Laws Today IndianKanoon News Article Blog Ipleaders 17.

It not only provides equality but also social justice. Also the Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 \\u200bled to the establishment of special courts to decide the cases related to the commission of offenses under this act. Section 18 of this Act makes the commission of offenses under this Act a non-bailable offense. In Jai Singh v. Union of India Rajasthan High Court and in Devrajiah v. B. Padmana of Madras High Court, the court defined the word untouchability.The court said that ‘The subject matter of Article 17 is not untouchable in its literal or grammatical sense but the ‘practice as it had developed historically in the country’. It refers to the social disabilities imposed on certain classes of persons because of their birth in certain castes. Hence, it does not cover the social boycott of a few individuals or their exclusion from religious services, etc. In the case of People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, AIR 1982 the Supreme Court held that when the rights under Article 17 are violated by any private individual then it will be the responsibility of the state to take action immediately. Merely because the aggrieved person could themself protect or enforce their invaded fundamental rights, did not absolve the State from its constitutional obligations. In State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale , the Supreme Court expressing its concern on the continuance of the practice of untouchability, held that it was an indirect form of slavery is only extension of the caste system. In this case, the accusation against the respondents was that they had forcibly restrained the complainant from taking water from a newly dug-up borewell because they were untouchable.

Abolition of titles (1) No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State. (2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State. (3) No person who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office of profit or trust under the State, accept without the consent of the President any title from any foreign State. (4) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the President, accept any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any foreign State. Editorial Comment - Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution abolishes all titles and prohibits the state from conferring titles on any individual, whether they are a citizen or a non-citizen. However, military and academic distinctions are exceptions to this prohibition. This means that universities, for instance, can grant titles or honors to individuals based on their merit. Article 18(2) specifically prohibits Indian citizens from accepting titles from foreign states. Article 18(3) states that non-citizens holding positions of profit or trust under the Indian State require the President\\'s consent to accept titles from foreign states. Additionally, Article 18(4) stipulates that no person, whether a citizen or a non-citizen, holding a position of profit or trust, can accept any gifts, salary, or office from a foreign state without the President\\'s consent. Clauses (3) and (4) aim to ensure the loyalty of non-citizens towards the Indian State and prevent any breach of trust. A \"title\" refers to an attachment to one\\'s name, such as a prefix or suffix (e.g., Sir, Nawab, Maharaja). In a democracy, the creation of titles and titular glories is discouraged as it goes against the principles of social equality. However, it is argued that titles like \"Bharat Ratna,\" \"Padma Vibhushan,\" and \"Padma Shri\" (introduced in 1954) are not prohibited under Article 18 because they signify state recognition of exceptional work by citizens in various fields. It is important to note that Article 18 does not confer any fundamental right but rather imposes restrictions on executive and legislative powers. The conferral of titles is seen as contrary to the fundamental principle of equality guaranteed by Article 14, which ensures equal treatment of all citizens. In the landmark judgment Balaji Raghavan v. Union of India , AIR 1996, the court held that National awards aren’t titles under clause 1 of Article 18. A committee (High Level Review Committee: chaired by the Vice-President) was set up by the Government in which it states that the awards should be given based on recommendations of names given by various state governments. These recommendations will be reviewed by the Centre government. After this committee, the names will be sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and finally sent to the President for the final verdict. It is important to remember that there are no guidelines given for the Bharat Ratna award. \\u200b In the case of Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India (2017) , a complaint was lodged in this matter questioning the usage of the term ‘senior advocate’ before the names of the advocates. The Supreme Court ruled that this is not the title, but rather a demarcation, and therefore does not violate Article 18 of the Indian Constitution.

[ Editorial Comment - Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India guarantees six fundamental freedoms to every citizen of India. Though all of these six Fundamental Freedoms are not absolute. They contain certain restraints and exceptions within them which are postulated in Article 19(2) to 19(6). Freedom of Speech and Expression - Article 19(1)(a) grants citizens the right to freely express their thoughts, opinions, and ideas. This includes the freedom to express oneself through speech, writing, printing, visual representations, or any other means. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right for the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign nations, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offense, or the sovereignty and integrity of Parliament. The first set of grounds, namely, the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States and public order are all grounds referable to national interest. Whereas the second set of grounds, namely, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation and incitement to an offense are all concerned with the interest of the society. However it is the constitutional obligation of the judiciary to ensure that the restrictions imposed by a law on the media are reasonable and relate to the purposes specified in Article 19(2).Because reasonable restrictions contemplated under the Indian Constitution brings the matter in the domain of the court as the question of reasonableness is a question primarily for the Court to decide. Freedom of speech and expression is a crucial right which is recognized by Article 19(l)(a), It has been held to be a basic and indivisible right for a democratic polity. In Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras ,Patanjali Shastri, C.J. observed:“Freedom of speech and of the press lay at the foundation of all democratic organizations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular government, is possible”The expression ‘Freedom of press’ is part of the ambit of article 19 and it means the right to print and publish without any interference from the state or any other public authority. But this Freedom, like other freedoms, cannot be absolute but is subject to well known exceptions acknowledged in the public interests, which in India are enumerated in Article 19(2) of the constitution. Thus, in Prabhu Dutt v. Union of India the Supreme Court has held that the right to know news and information regarding administration of the Government is included in the freedom of press. But this right is not absolute and restrictions can be imposed on it in the interest of the society and the individual from which the press obtains information. They can obtain information from an individual when he voluntarily agrees to give such information. In Bennett Coleman & Co v. Union of India (1972), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the freedom of the press embodies the right of the people to free speech and expression. It was held that “Freedom of the press is both qualitative and quantitative. Freedom lies both in circulation and in content.” In the case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, 2015 Section 66A of the Information Technology Act was challenged. Under this section, there were several arrests which were made due to which a wide outrage was seen in society. The petitioners said that this Article is infringing the Freedom of Speech and Expression. The Supreme Court stroked down this provision saying that this provision is too vague and prone to misuse. In the State of U.P. v. Raj Narain (1975) , the Supreme Court observed that the right to know is derived from the concept of freedom of speech. The Court further held that the people of this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their public functionaries. Right to speak includes the right to not speak or the right to remain silent. In Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala (1986) , the Supreme Court upheld the right to silence of three students who were expelled from school because they refused to sing the National Anthem. The Court held that no person can be compelled to sing the National Anthem if he has genuine conscientious objections based on his religious belief. Hence, the right to speak and the right to express includes the right not to express and to be silent. Freedom to Assemble Peacefully - Article 19(1)(b) ensures the right to peacefully assemble and hold public meetings or processions without arms. This right allows citizens to come together for various purposes, such as protests, demonstrations, or discussions. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, sovereignty, and integrity of India. In Himmat Lal v. Police Commissioner, Bombay (1972) , the Supreme Court struck down a rule that empowered the police commissioner to impose a total ban on all public meetings and processions. It was held that the state could only make regulations in aid of the right of assembly of citizens and could impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order but no rule could be prescribed prohibiting all meetings or processions altogether. Freedom to Form Associations or Unions -  Article 19(1)(c) guarantees the right to form associations or unions. Citizens have the freedom to form social, cultural, economic, or political associations or unions. This right allows individuals to collectively pursue common goals or interests. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, morality, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In Damyanti v. Union of India (1971), the Supreme Court upheld the right of the members of an association to continue the association with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the association. Freedom to Move Freely -  Article 19(1)(d) ensures the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. Citizens have the liberty to move within the country, reside in any part of India, and settle in any place of their choice. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, security of the State, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In Chambara soy v. Union of India (2007), some persons had blocked a road due to which the petitioner was delayed in taking his ailing son to the hospital and his son died on arrival at the hospital. The Supreme Court held that the right of the petitioner to move freely under Article 19(1)(d) has been violated due to the road blockage. The Court held that the State is liable to pay the compensation for the death of the petitioner’s son due to the inaction on the part of the State authorities in removing the aforesaid blockage. Freedom to Reside and Settle - Article 19(1)(e) guarantees the right to reside and settle in any part of India. Citizens have the freedom to choose their place of residence and settle anywhere within the country. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, protection of scheduled tribes, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In the case of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Friends Co-op. Housing Society Ltd.(1995) , it was held by the Supreme Court that the right to residence under Article 19(1)(e) includes the right to shelter and to construct houses for that purpose. Freedom to Practice Profession, Occupation, Trade, or Business -  Article 19(1)(g) provides the right to practice any profession, occupation, trade, or business. Citizens have the freedom to choose and engage in their preferred livelihoods. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of the general public, professional qualifications, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In the landmark judgment, Chindamanrao v. State of M.P. (AIR 1951) , the Central Provinces imposed a ban on the making of Bidis during the Agricultural Seasons. The manufacturing of Bidis used to work as an additional income for the women of the local area. So the act by the government of the Central province was challenged in the Supreme Court. Court decided that the act made by the government is arbitrary and does not fall under the reasonable restrictions. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997) has observed that the sexual harassment of working women in workplaces violates the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g). In this case, comprehensive guidelines and binding directions were issued by the court to prevent the incidents of sexual harassment of women at workplaces in both public and private sectors. ] References IndianKanoon ConstitutionofIndia.net Blog Ipleaders Legal Service India Wikipedia [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, it amended the Clauses (2), (3), and (4) of Article 19.

The extensive establishment of cooperatives was envisioned as one of the attempts to achieve social and economic justice and the equitable distribution of the advantages of progress. According to this Amendment, these societies are given constitutional status and are legally protected while also maintaining their autonomous or democratic functioning. The Constitution was amended to require that the states guarantee the autonomy of cooperatives, and as a result, state governments are now required to support the voluntary formation, autonomous decision-making, democratic control, and operation of cooperatives. The Act witnessed many changes such as modification in Part III of Article 19(1)(c) with the insertion of the words “or co-operative societies”, and the addition of Article 43B (working towards enhancing the co-Operative Societies’ Voluntary formation, independent operation, and professional management) and Part IX B to the Indian Constitution. However, the 97th Amendment faced challenges in the High Court of Gujarat as the Parliament didn’t ask for approval from the state legislatures before passing the bill. The ratification/approval is necessary for matters concerning states and since the cooperative societies are a part of the state legislature, ratification was required. On July 20, 2021, the Supreme Court of India declared the 97th Amendment Act Unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court ratification from states was necessary to pass the amendment which didn’t take place. The Supreme Court also said that the responsibility of Multistate Co-Operative societies is of the Centre while that of the State co-operative societies is of the state.

Protection in respect of conviction for offences (1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. (2) No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Editorial Comment - Article 20 of the Indian Constitution safeguards certain rights in criminal proceedings. It provides protection against self-incrimination, double jeopardy, and retrospective punishment. Article 20(1) prohibits the imposition of retrospective punishment. It states that no person shall be punished for an act that was not an offense at the time it was committed. This provision ensures that individuals cannot be held accountable for actions that were legal when they occurred but were later made illegal by subsequent legislation. In the landmark judgment, Kedar Nath v. State of West Bengal the Supreme Court held that when an act is declared a criminal offense by the legislature and provides penalties for it, such declaration is always prospective and cannot be applied retrospectively as per the provisions of Article 20(1) However, it is important to note that this clause prohibits only the procedure of sentencing and convicting, not the trial itself. Therefore, a person accused under a particular procedure cannot claim protection under this clause or the doctrine of ex post facto law. In the case of Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan involving the Narcotics, Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances Act, the court opined that Article 20 prohibits only conviction and punishment under an ex post facto law, not the trial or prosecution itself. Furthermore, a trial conducted under a different procedure from the one existing at the time of the offense does not fall within the scope of this provision and cannot be deemed unconstitutional. In another significant judgment, Maru Ram Etc. v. Union Of India & Anr (1980 AIR 2147) , the Court observed that Article 20(1) also encompasses the principle that penalties for an offense should not be retrospectively increased beyond what existed at the time of the offense. However, there is an exception to the restriction imposed by this provision. In the case of Rattan Lal v. The State of Punjab , the Supreme Court allowed for retrospective application of criminal laws in situations where the issue at hand concerns the reduction of punishment for the said offense. Article 20(2) prohibits a person from being prosecuted and punished for the same offense more than once. This principle of double jeopardy prevents individuals from being subjected to multiple trials or punishments for the same offense. Once a person has been acquitted or convicted and punished for a particular offense, they cannot be tried or punished again for the same offense. In the case of Venkataraman v. Union of India , the Supreme Court of India established that this provision deals exclusively with Judicial punishments and provides that no person is prosecuted twice by the judicial authorities. The most crucial landmark judgement came in the case of Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay , where the person accused was possessing some amount of gold, which was against lex loci at the time and gold was confiscated by the customs authority. And, later when the person was prosecuted before a criminal court, the court was confronted with the question whether this amounts to Double Jeopardy. But, the Supreme Court observed that departmental proceedings, i.e. by Customs Authority, in this case, doesn’t amount to trial by a judicial tribunal, thus the proceedings before the criminal court is not barred in this case and the proceedings can go on. In a nutshell Departmental Proceedings are independent of trial by a judicial court or tribunal. However, the prosecution may happen if the facts are distinct in subsequent proceedings. Same was established by the Supreme Court of India in case of A.A. Mulla v. State of Maharashtra and was observed that; Article 20 (2) would not be attracted in those cases where the facts are distinct in subsequent offence or punishment. Article 20(3) ensures that no person accused of an offense shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. This means that an individual cannot be forced to provide evidence or testimony that may incriminate themselves. It is a fundamental right that protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses in their own criminal prosecution. Prohibition against self-incrimination could only be put into effect if the person is accused of a criminal offence. This doctrine could not be invoked for cases other than criminal cases. Also, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Raja Narayanlal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry , to claim the immunity from being self-incriminated, there must exist a formal accusation against the person and mere general inquiry and investigation don’t form grounds for the same. These safeguards provided under Article 20 are essential components of a fair and just legal system. They uphold the principles of fairness, protection against self-incrimination, and the prevention of arbitrary or excessive punishment. It\\'s important to note that these protections are applicable in criminal proceedings and serve as a shield against certain violations of individual rights. However, reasonable restrictions and limitations can be imposed in the interests of public order, security of the State, or the proper administration of justice.

Protection of life and personal liberty No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Editorial Comment - Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to protection of life and personal liberty. It ensures certain safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of life and liberty. Article 21 asserts that no person shall be deprived of their life except according to the procedure established by law. This means that every individual has the right to live, and their life cannot be taken away except in accordance with the prescribed legal procedures. The right to life encompasses various aspects, including the right to live with dignity, the right to livelihood, and the right to a healthy environment. Article 21 also protects the personal liberty of individuals. It states that no person shall be deprived of their personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. Personal liberty includes the freedom to move freely, the freedom to choose one\\'s place of residence, and the freedom to engage in any lawful occupation or profession. \\u200bIn the landmark judgment, A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras , the Supreme Court held that personal liberty means the “liberty of the body” which is freedom from arrest and detention from false detention. The Supreme Court added that the meaning of the word ‘law’ means state made law only. So clearly this was a narrow interpretation of the word Personal freedom and Law. \\u200bBut in later cases, this view was redressed by the Judiciary. In the case of R.C. Cooper v. Union of India (1970) the court held that the word personal liberty would not only include Article 21 but also includes the 6 Fundamental Freedoms given under Article 19 (1). \\u200bIn the case of Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1963, the court adopted a wider meaning of personal liberty and said that it will include all the rights which are given under Article 19(1). In the landmark judgment Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978), Supreme Court held that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 is not limited to mere animal existence but includes the right to live with dignity. The court emphasized that the procedure established by law must be fair, just, and reasonable, and it cannot be arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable. In Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985), the court recognized the right to livelihood as an integral part of the right to life under Article 21. It held that the eviction of pavement dwellers without providing alternative arrangements would violate their right to life and personal liberty. In the landmark judgment, Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997), the supreme court addressed the issue of sexual harassment at the workplace. The court held that the right to a safe and secure working environment is a fundamental right flowing from Article 21. It laid down guidelines to prevent and redress sexual harassment at workplaces until appropriate legislation was enacted. In, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and Ors (2014) , \\u200bThe National Legal Services Authority filed a PIL to protect the interests of transgendered persons. The court held that the Gender of a person is to be decided by the person themself after looking into the Right to Life Article. So all the rights which are given to normal people must be given to transgendered people like Public toilets, medical care for transgendered persons and the provisions of reservations under Article 15 and 16 must be extended to them as they classify as a minority section. In the case, Animal Welfare Board v. A. Nagaraja (2014) , rights which are given to animals were up for contention (especially bulls used in Jallikattu festival). In this case, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) brought the attention of the court towards the cruelty and inhuman behavior which is faced by the animals which are used in the Jallikattu festival. \\u200b The court held that they have a duty under the doctrine of ‘parens patriae’ to take care of the rights of animals. Article 51A (g) of the Constitution also gives the principle of compassion towards living beings and animals. So under this case, the Supreme Court ruled that Jallikattu is constitutionally void. In another landmark judgment, K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) (privacy judgment) the Supreme Court recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right protected under Article 21. The court held that privacy is an essential aspect of personal liberty and dignity and is intrinsic to the entire constitutional scheme. In Common Cause v. Union of India (2018) , the court legalized passive euthanasia and recognized the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21. The court held that individuals have the right to refuse medical treatment or life support and can make an advance directive specifying their wishes in case of terminal illness. Article 21 also prohibits arbitrary or unlawful detention. It ensures that no person can be detained without proper legal justification or without following the due process of law. It safeguards against arbitrary arrests and protects individuals from being unlawfully deprived of their freedom. It also encompasses the right to a fair trial. It guarantees that every person accused of an offense shall have the right to a fair and impartial trial, including the right to legal representation, the right to be heard, and the right to present evidence in their defense. In the case, A.K. Roy v. Union of India (AIR 1982) (NSA case), the Supreme Court discussed whether the provisions of Natural Justice should be applied to the National Security act or not. This Act took away many important rights of a detained person like Right to be represented by a lawyer, Right to cross-examine the detaining authority etc. The court held that Natural justice is important but it cannot be applied in all the acts. It is important to look at the circumstances and the purpose of making the Act. So based on this logic the court upheld the NSA Act (1980). The interpretation and scope of Article 21 have evolved through various landmark judgments of the Supreme Court, expanding its ambit to include protection against torture, custodial violence, and the right to a clean and healthy environment. It\\'s important to note that reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the rights guaranteed under Article 21 in the interests of public order, national security, public health, or morality. However, such restrictions must be fair, just, and in accordance with the principles of reasonableness and proportionality.

It aims to protect the rights and welfare of children by prohibiting their employment in certain hazardous occupations or processes. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory, mine, or hazardous occupation. The intention is to prevent exploitation, safeguard the health and development of children, and ensure their access to education. The article allows for certain exceptions where child labor may be permitted, such as engaging children in non-hazardous family-based work, work as part of a school\\'s curriculum, or in any other harmless or innocent occupation. This article also empowers the government to enact legislation to determine the specific occupations and processes that are considered hazardous for children. The government has the authority to impose necessary restrictions and regulations to enforce this provision effectively. Article 24 is closely linked to Article 21A, which guarantees the right to education for children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. By prohibiting child labor, Article 24 promotes the realization of the right to education and ensures that children have the opportunity to develop their potential and skills through proper schooling.

It encompasses various aspects related to the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion.

The state has the authority to regulate or restrict secular activities that may be associated with religious practices, such as social reforms, economic activities, and other activities unrelated to the core aspects of religion.

Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt (1954) , Supreme Court dealt with the power of the state to intervene in the administration of religious institutions. The Supreme Court held that while the state can regulate and supervise the administration of religious institutions, it should not interfere with the essential religious practices and customs of a denomination unless they are deemed to be socially harmful or against public order. In the case of Acharya Jadishwaranand Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, 1984 (Anand Marga Case), the Supreme Court held that the Tandava dance which is followed by the community of Anand Marga is not an essential part of the religion.

Article 26(a) \\xa0Right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes.The right to establish and maintain religious institutions is given to every religious institution.

Article 26(c) details the right to own and acquire movable and immovable property. The state can regulate the property of a religious denomination by law.

Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. Editorial Comment - Article 27 ensures that individuals are not forced to contribute through taxes towards the promotion or maintenance of any specific religion or religious denomination.

The aim of Article 27 is to maintain a secular state where the government remains impartial towards all religions and does not favor or promote any specific religion using public funds. It ensures that taxpayers\\' money is not utilized to endorse or support any particular religious agenda, thus preserving the religious freedom and equality of citizens.

This payment was demanded to meet the expenses of the Commissioner and his office which was set up for the administration of the religious institution. \\u200b In Nasima Khatun v.

Students attending these institutions have the right to choose whether or not to receive religious instruction. In educational institutions that are not wholly maintained by state funds, students belonging to a particular religion have the right to attend religious worship or religious instruction conducted by the institution.

It aims to protect the interests of religious, linguistic, and cultural minorities in India. Any section of citizens residing in India having a distinct language, script, or culture of its own has the right to conserve and promote its language, script, or culture.

Minority communities, whether based on religion or language, have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. This enables minorities to establish educational institutions that cater to their specific cultural and linguistic needs. Article 29 also prohibits discrimination against any citizen on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them with respect to admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the state.

Editorial Comment - Article 30 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. All minorities, whether based on religion or language, have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. This includes the right to determine the type of institution, its affiliation, and the right to appoint staff. The state cannot discriminate against any educational institution on the grounds of its minority status while granting aid. Minority institutions should receive the same treatment and protection as institutions established by the majority. While minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions, they must still adhere to reasonable regulations that the state may impose in the interest of maintaining standards of education, ensuring welfare, or preventing maladministration. The purpose of Article 30 is to protect the educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities, allowing them to preserve and promote their distinct culture, language, and religious identity through educational institutions of their choice. It recognizes the importance of minority communities in the nation\\'s diversity and provides them with the freedom to establish and manage educational institutions that cater to their specific needs and aspirations. Article 31(A) was added as part of the 42nd Constitutional Amendment which states that in case of any property acquired by the government of an educational institution then it is the duty of the government to give appropriate compensation.

State of Gujarat (1974), the Supreme Court clarified that minority educational institutions have the right to admit students belonging to their own community and can give preference to them while making admissions, as long as the admission process is fair and transparent. In D.A.V. College, Jullundur v. State of Punjab (1971), the Supreme Court held that minority institutions have the right to appoint teachers of their choice, subject to their qualifications and suitability. It emphasized the importance of preserving the minority character of such institutions. In this case, S.P. Mittal v. Union of India 1983 , the court discussed Auroville, a township formed on the ideals of Sri Aurobindo. Tamil Nadu government took management of this township and filed a presidential ordinance which later on became The Auroville (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1980 . Seeing that the government took control of a ‘religious’ enterprise, the Constitutional validity of the Act was challenged on 4 grounds. One of the grounds was that it was violative of Article 29 and 30. It was held by the bench that the aforesaid Act does not violate Article 29 and 30. The court held that it, in no way curtailed their right or prevented any citizen from conserving its own language, script or culture and thus was not violative of Article 29. Also in this case, in order to seek protection under Article 30, one must prove that they are a linguistic or religious minority and the institution in question was established by them. Considering that Auroville was not religious and was founded on the ideology of Sri Aurobindo, they could not seek protection under these articles. In the landmark case T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002), the Supreme Court dealt with the autonomy of minority educational institutions and their right to establish and administer institutions of their choice. The Supreme Court held that minority institutions have the right to administer their affairs, including the right to appoint staff, but they must still operate within certain reasonable regulations imposed by the state.

(4) The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitution. Editorial Comment - Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees the right to constitutional remedies. It is considered one of the most crucial provisions in the Constitution as it empowers individuals to seek protection and enforcement of their fundamental rights directly from the Supreme Court of India. Article 32 grants every individual the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. This means that if someone believes their fundamental rights have been violated, they can approach the Supreme Court directly for relief. It also ensures that not only do individuals have the right to move the Supreme Court, but the Court also has the power to issue appropriate orders, directions, or writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court can issue five types of writs under Article 32: Habeas Corpus : To ensure the release of a person who has been unlawfully detained. When Article 21 was suspended during the National Emergency, it was held in Addl. District Magistrate, Jabalpur v. Shukla (Habeas Corpus Case) that an order of preventive detention could not be challenged even if it violated the parent Act (i.e, the Act relating to preventive detention). The 44th Amendment, 1978, has provided that Article 21, relating to personal liberty cannot be suspended even during an emergency. The writ of Habeas Corpus is a check on the governmental powers to curtail the liberty of a person; its fundamental purpose is to ensure timely review of illegal detention. The scope and extent of this writ is enunciated by the Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra v. Bhaurao Punjabrao Gawande . The Court stated that the writ of habeas corpus has been described as a \"constitutional privilege or the first security of civil liberty\" as it provides a speedy remedy against illegal detention. By the virtue of this writ, the Court directs the authority which has detained a person to produce the body of the person before the Court so that it can assess the legitimacy of the arrest or detention. Mandamus : To direct a public official or authority to perform a duty they are legally bound to perform. In the case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India , the court entailed that a writ cannot be issued against the President of India for fixing the number of judges in High Courts and filling vacancies. In E.A. Co-operative Society v. Maharastra, A.I.R. 1966 S.C. 1449 case the Court opined that the writ of mandamus can be issued when the government denies to itself a jurisdiction which it undoubtedly has under the law In Bombay Municipality v. Advance Builders, AIR 1972 SC 793 case, Bombay Municipality\\xa0had prepared a town planning scheme which had been also approved by the State Government. However, no action was taken for a long time. The Court opined that the writ of mandamus can be issued where an authority vested with a power improperly refuses to exercise it and directed the municipality to implement a planning scheme. In State of West Bengal v. Nuruddin(1998) 8 SCC 143 case, the Supreme Court held the writ of mandamus is a personal action where the respondent has not done the duty they were prescribed to do by law. The performance of the duty is the right of the applicant. In The Praga Tools Corporation v. C.V. Imanual, 1969  and Sohanlal v. Union of India, (1957) the Supreme Court held that mandamus might under certain circumstances lie against a private individual if it is established that he has colluded with a public authority. Then, in the case of Manjula Manjori v. Director of Public Instruction , the publisher of a book had applied for the writ of mandamus against the Director of Public Instruction for the inclusion of his book in the list of books which were approved as text-books in schools. But the writ was not allowed as the matter was completely within the discretion of D.I.P and he was not bound to approve the book. In the case of Binny Ltd. & Anr v. V. Sadasivan & Ors (2005), the Supreme Court laid down the scope of mandamus. It stated that a writ of mandamus is not applicable against any private wrong. It can be issued only when any public authority exercises its duty unlawfully or refuses to perform its duty within the ambit of the law. In the case of Ramakrishna Mission v. Kago Kunya (2019) , The Supreme Court ruled that where a contract is of private nature or has no connection with any public authority, it does not fall within the purview of the writ of mandamus. Prohibition : To prevent a lower court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction. In, Brij Khandelwal v. India (1975) the Delhi High Court refused to issue a prohibition against the Central Government from engaging in a boundary dispute agreement with Sri Lanka. The judgment was founded on the basis that there is no bar against the government performing executive or administrative duties. With the idea of natural justice and the growth of the concept of fairness, there is no longer a tolerable view, even in administrative tasks. If any of the grounds on which the writ of prohibition is issued is present, the writ can now be issued to anybody, regardless of the nature of the duty fulfilled by it. Prohibition is currently considered as a broad remedy for judicial control of impacting quasi-judicial as well as administrative actions. In the case, S. Govind Menon v. Union of India (1967) a Writ of prohibition was issued by a higher court, namely the Kerala High Court, to a lower court in order to take over jurisdiction that was not initially vested, or in other words, to compel lower courts to retain their jurisdictional limitations. The writ can be issued when there is an excess of jurisdiction as well as when there is an absence of jurisdiction. In the case, Hari Vishnu v. Syed Ahmed Ishaque (1955) dealt with distinctions between writs of prohibition and certiorari. The verdict, in this case, distinguished between certiorari and prohibition writs and said that when the lower court issues a decision, the petitioner must file a certiorari petition since prohibition writs can only be submitted when judgment has not yet been given. In this case, Prudential Capital Markets Ltd v. The State of A.P. and others, (2000) it was questionable whether the prohibition writ could be issued against the district forum/state commission which had already passed judgments in the depositors’ consumer cases. The Court held that after the execution of the order, the writ of prohibition cannot be issued, the judgment can neither be prevented nor stopped. Certiorari : To quash an order passed by a lower court, tribunal, or authority. In Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai & Ors., the Supreme Court has explained the meaning, ambit and scope of the writ of Certiorari. Also, in this it was explained that Certiorari is always available against inferior courts and not against equal or higher courts, i.e., it cannot be issued by a High Court against any High Court or benches much less to the Supreme Court and any of its benches. Then in the case of T.C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa & Anr., it was held by the constitution bench that certiorari may and is generally granted when a court has acted (i) without jurisdiction or (ii) in excess of its jurisdiction. In Hari Bishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque the Supreme Court said that “the court issuing certiorari to quash, however, could not substitute its own decision on the merits or give directions to be complied with by the court or tribunal. Its work was destructive, it simply wiped out the order passed without jurisdiction, and left the matter there.” In Naresh S. Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra , it was said that High Court’s judicial orders are open to being corrected by certiorari and that writ is not available against the High Court. Quo Warranto : To inquire into the legality of a person\\'s claim to a public office. In the case of G.D. Karkare v. T.L. Shevde, the High Court of Nagpur observed that “In proceedings for a writ of quo-warranto, the applicant does not seek to enforce any right of his as such nor does he complain of any non-performance of duty towards him. What is in question is the right of the non-applicant to hold the office and an order that is passed is an order ousting him from that office.” In the case of Bharati Reddy v. The State Of Karnataka (2018) , the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued based on assumptions, inferences, or speculations concerning the fact of accomplishment of qualifying conditions. There must be an establishment of the fact that a public officer is abusing lawful powers not vested to him within the public authority. Direct Access to Supreme Court: Unlike Article 226, which pertains to the High Courts and enables individuals to seek writs for enforcement of their fundamental rights, Article 32 provides a direct avenue to the Supreme Court for this purpose. Suspension During Emergency: During a proclamation of Emergency, the right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 can be suspended. However, the suspension does not extend to fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 (protections in case of conviction and protection of life and personal liberty, respectively).

[ Editorial Note -Article 370 of the Constitution of India provided a special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, granting it a degree of autonomy within the Indian union. Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state\\'s final political status. This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state\\'s final political status.  This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 and Article 35A were closely linked in terms of their impact on the constitutional and legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 was the constitutional provision that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A was a legal provision that flowed from Article 370 and gave the state of Jammu and Kashmir the power to define who is a \"permanent resident\" of the state, and to confer special rights and privileges to these residents. Article 35A was added to the Indian Constitution through a Presidential Order in 1954, which was issued under the authority of Article 370. The provision allowed the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature to define permanent residents of the state and provide them with special rights and privileges, such as the right to own property, access to government jobs, and scholarships. The provision also prohibited non-permanent residents from acquiring any of these rights or privileges. In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist. To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as \\'Inoperative\\' even though it still exists in the constitution. On 5 August, issued a Presidential Order C.O. 272 ; the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood inoperative, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states.  The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorized the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so. To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (1) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase \\'Constituent Assembly of the State\\' with \\'Legislative Assembly of the State\\'. Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.] Part IV – Directive Principles of State Policy 36.

The Amendment hailed as one of the more impactful Amendments as it led to the number of representatives from both houses being equal.

Also Refer ] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Fifty-Second Amendment) Act, 1985, introduced as an anti-defection bill in the parliament to prohibit its members from hopping between different political parties and inserted a new Schedule in the constitution i.e. the 10th schedule. It altered the provisions of Articles 101, where it laid down the grounds of defection for members of either house of Parliament or state assemblies or councils. It aims to prevent political defections for reasons of office and other considerations from causing harm to democracy. Its proposed solution is to bar Members of Parliament and State Legislatures who deviate from party politics from continuing to hold their political office. This was not passed without a major change in the country’s political landscape. Nevertheless, it is the highest-level document drafted by our democracy and has the potential to make Indian politics more transparent. Aside from enhancing political freedoms, this amendment also contains provisions to curb corruption. The constitution’s anti-defection provisions were a result of a series of debates over the issue.

On 2nd January, 2017, a seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that re-promulgation of ordinances is a fraud on the Constitution and a subversion of democratic legislative processes. The majority Judgment, authored by Justice DY Chandrachud, held that the requirement of placing the ordinance before the Legislature is mandatory; Justice Madan B Lokur observed that it is directory; Justice Thakur, the Chief Justice of India as he was then, in his separate concurring opinion, preferred to leave the ‘question of interpretation of Articles 123 (2) and 213(2) in so far as the obligation of the Government to place the ordinance before the Parliament/legislature open. The Supreme Court of India’s seven-judge Constitution Bench ruled that the “RE-PROMULGATION OF ORDINANCES” must be taken to be a violation of our Indian Constitution as it undermines parliamentary legislative procedures.

On 2nd January, 2017, a seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that re-promulgation of ordinances is a fraud on the Constitution and a subversion of democratic legislative processes. The majority Judgment, authored by Justice DY Chandrachud, held that the requirement of placing the ordinance before the Legislature is mandatory; Justice Madan B Lokur observed that it is directory; Justice Thakur, the Chief Justice of India as he was then, in his separate concurring opinion, preferred to leave the ‘question of interpretation of Articles 123 (2) and 213(2) in so far as the obligation of the Government to place the ordinance before the Parliament/legislature open. The Supreme Court of India’s seven-judge Constitution Bench ruled that the “RE-PROMULGATION OF ORDINANCES” must be taken to be a violation of our Indian Constitution as it undermines parliamentary legislative procedures. This Bench furthermore ruled that: “The approval and gratification of the President of India, under Article 123, and the Governor, under Article 213, when issuing an Ordinance is not excluded from judicial process and legal challenge.”(https: indiankanoon.org/doc/107225908/, https: blog.ipleaders.in unconstitutionality-of-the-re-promulgation-of-ordinances-the-krishna-kumar-singh-conundrum/)] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Thirty-Eighth Amendment) Act, 1975, codified the declaration of Emergency and empowered the State to remove fundamental rights during a state of emergency.

It introduced the concept of gram panchayats, which is a third-level government that deals directly with the public and works to address problems at the grass-roots level. Article 243 (b) defines the gram sabha, which consists of persons registered on the electoral rolls. It is the basic unit of the Panchayati Raj Institution. This institution is empowered to perform various functions at the village level, including establishing schools and health facilities. This act granted constitutional status to panchayats and democratized decentralization. It also empowered panchayats at all levels to levy taxes and collect duties. It further ensures that people at the grassroots level are more engaged in the governance process. It focused on improving rural political structures and the rights of vulnerable populations.

[ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, dealt with the devolution of power into the systems of Municipalities or Urban Local Governments. It mandated the setting up and devolution of powers to Urban local bodies (ULBs) or city governments as the lowest unit of governance in cities and towns. This landmark initiative of the Government of India was built upon the premise that all ‘power’ in a democracy rightfully belongs to ‘the people’.

To achieve this, the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution had to be revised. Four of these languages were added to the existing list of languages recognized as official languages. With this addition, the list now held 22 constitutionally recognized languages. It gave minority languages the identity of an officially recognized language in the Constitution.

[Repealed by the Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1971.] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Twenty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 1971, the 26th Amendment of Indian Constitution of 1971 removed Articles 291. The former dealt with the details of privy purse sums and the latter guaranteed specific rights and privileges to rulers of princely states. The ‘privy purse’ was guaranteed by Articles 291 in the Indian constitution, which ensured that princes would receive tax-free privy purses, equivalent to one-fourth of the money they earned earlier. Thus, with the omission of Articles 291, the privy purse which was paid to former princely states was removed. Important Verdict-Shri Raghunathrao Ganpatrao vs Union Of India ] 292.

However, it was later amended to 58 for employees of the All-India Services, the Central Government, and many State governments.

[ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Seventy-fifth Amendment) Act, 1993, contains provisions for the establishment of rent control tribunals and amended article 323B. The Indian Constitution has made provisions for setting up State-level Rent Tribunals, which will provide timely relief to rent litigants. These tribunals will be able to decide disputes on rent and will be independent of all courts, except the Supreme Court. Also Refer ] Part XV – Elections 324. Superintendence, direction and control of elections to be vested in an Election Commission (1) The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to Parliament and to the Legislature of every State and of elections to the offices of President and Vice-President held under this Constitution shall be vested in a Commission (referred to in this Constitution as the Election Commission). (2) The Election Commission shall consist of the Chief Election Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners, if any, as the President may from time to time fix and the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in that behalf by Parliament, be made by the President. (3) When any other Election Commissioner is so appointed the Chief Election Commissioner shall act as the Chairman of the Election Commission.

(6) The President, or the Governor of a State, shall, when so requested by the Election Commission, make available to the Election Commission or to a Regional Commissioner such staff as may be necessary for the discharge of the functions conferred on the Election Commission by clause (1). [ Editorial comment - The Constitution (Nineteenth Amendment) Act, 1966, nullified the tribunals in India and instead gave the authority to the High Court to hear the trial of election petitions. The abolition of tribunals and the restoring of their powers to the High Court proved to be a turning point in the matters having a connection with elections in India. This made the High Court superior and their hold stronger. It also amended Article 324, subclause (1) and accordingly the Election Commission is given the authority to supervise, direct, and oversee elections.The Representation of the People Act of 1951 was also modified and it rendered the electoral tribunals’ appointment and authority null and void. A special provision concerning the ability to appoint election tribunals for the adjudication of uncertainties and issues coming out of or concerning elections to Parliament and the Legislatures of States was eliminated.] 325. No person to be ineligible for inclusion in, or to claim to be included in a special, electoral roll on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex There shall be one general electoral roll for every territorial constituency for election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State and no person shall be ineligible for inclusion in any such roll or claim to be included in any special electoral roll for any such constituency on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them. 326. Elections to the House of the People and to the Legislative Assemblies of States to be on the basis of adult suffrage The elections to the House of the People and to the Legislative Assembly of every State shall be on the basis of adult suffrage; that is to say, every person who is a citizen of India and who is not less thaneighteen years of age on such date as may be fixed in that behalf by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature and is not otherwise disqualified under this Constitution or any law made by the appropriate Legislature on the ground of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime or corrupt or illegal practice, shall be entitled to be registered as a voter at any such election. [ Editroial comment -The Constitution (Sixty-first Amendment) Act, 1988, reduced the voting age for elections for Indian citizens from 21 years to 18 years. The voting age for an Indian citizen was decided as 21 years on the basis of adult suffrage. In simple words, any person below the age of 21 was not allowed to cast a vote in the elections for the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly of each State. With the introduction of this Amendment, a chance was given to unrepresented youths to express their views and emotions out in the open, thus inspiring them to participate in the political process.

As part of its investigation into allegations that members of socially and educationally disadvantaged groups had their rights violated, the Commission was granted the jurisdiction to perform the functions of a civil court according to an article in the constitution. Also Refer ] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (One Hundred and Five Amendment) Act, 2021, restored state governments’ authority to recognize economically and socially disadvantaged groups (SEBCs). A community for which the State in India may give “special provisions” or equality is classified as SEBCs, which contains the categories generally referred to as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The Supreme Court ruled that the separate State lists were exempt from the authority and obligations of the National Commission for Backward Classes. State governments’ ability to create the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) list was reinstated by the 105th Amendment of Indian constitution. It said that States are exempt from the National Commission’s requirement for consultation. Consequently, over one-fifth of all OBC communities benefitted from this. It reinstated a Supreme Court literal interpretation that took away the States’ ability to keep a state list of OBCs. States were granted the power to react swiftly to socioeconomic needs that are unique to a state or region. India already had a federal structure, and the Bill that was passed strengthened it much more. Also refer ] 339.

(2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the Central List of socially and educationally backward classes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) any socially and educationally backward class, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification.\". [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (One Hundred and Second Amendment) Act, 2018, grants powers to the President to declare a caste as an SEBC, and the President may make an amendment to the list with a law passed by the Parliament. But states cannot declare a new caste. All they can do is recommend it. This means that the state government cannot declare a new caste as a BC (Backward Class).The 102 amendment of the Indian constitution (i.e. 102 caa) seeks to give the National Commission for Backward Classes a constitutional status, making it a quasi-independent body that examines welfare measures and complaints for socially and educationally backward classes. The commission was to be equal to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. Also Refer ] Part XVII – Official Language 343.

Unfortunately, the then-current state of affairs in the State still didn’t offer much hope for fair and peaceful election polls to the State Legislative Assembly.

[ Editorial Note -Article 370 of the Constitution of India provided a special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, granting it a degree of autonomy within the Indian union. Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state\\'s final political status. This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state\\'s final political status.  This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 and Article 35A were closely linked in terms of their impact on the constitutional and legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 was the constitutional provision that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A was a legal provision that flowed from Article 370 and gave the state of Jammu and Kashmir the power to define who is a \"permanent resident\" of the state, and to confer special rights and privileges to these residents. Article 35A was added to the Indian Constitution through a Presidential Order in 1954, which was issued under the authority of Article 370. The provision allowed the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature to define permanent residents of the state and provide them with special rights and privileges, such as the right to own property, access to government jobs, and scholarships. The provision also prohibited non-permanent residents from acquiring any of these rights or privileges. In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist. To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as \\'Inoperative\\' even though it still exists in the constitution. On 5 August, issued a Presidential Order C.O. 272 ; the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood inoperative, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states.  The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorized the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so. To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (1) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase \\'Constituent Assembly of the State\\' with \\'Legislative Assembly of the State\\'. Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.] 371. Special provision with respect to the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat (2) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the President may by order made with respect tothe State of Maharashtra or Gujarat, provide for any special responsibility of the Governor for- (a) the establishment of separate development boards for Vidarbha, Marathwada,and the rest of Maharashtra or, as the case may be, Saurashtra, Kutch and the rest of Gujarat with the provision that a report on the working of each of rest of these boards will be placed each year before the State Legislative Assembly; (b) the equitable allocation of funds for developmental expenditure over the said areas, subject to the requirements of the State as a whole; and (c) an equitable arrangement providing adequate facilities for technical education and vocational training, and adequate opportunities for employment in service under the control of the State Government, in respect of all the said areas, subject to the requirements of the State as a whole. [ Editorial comment - The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, this Article was replaced with a new one that applies to the states of Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Bombay. This introduced a special provision that enables the President to direct the creation of regional committees within a state’s Legislative Assembly. Also Refer ] 371A.

Explanation.--In this article, the Kohima, Mokokchung and Tuensang districts shall have the same meanings as in the State of Nagaland Act, 1962. [ Editorial comment - The Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act, 1962, is one of the most comprehensive amendments in the history of Indian Constitutional Amendments. Here, Nagaland was given specific constitutional provisions and status of a state, with special protection provided for in Article 371A. Within the State of Assam, Nagaland existed as a tribal region. The leaders of the Naga People’s Convention and the Government of India reached an agreement in July 1960.

[ Editorial Comment - The Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Act, 1960, clarified the extent of Parliament’s power to reduce the area of a state and addressed the issue of ceding Indian territory to foreign nations. As stipulated in the Indo-Pakistan Agreement of 1958, the amendment made it easier for India to cede the land of the Berubari Union to Pakistan. However, the West Bengal government did not agree to this agreement. Subsequently, the matter was taken to the Supreme Court, which declared that the transfer of Indian territory to a foreign country is not within Parliament’s authority to reduce a state’s area, as outlined in Article 3 of the Indian Constitution. It helped to resolve the conflicts by redrawing the boundaries and adjusting the territorial claims of each state.

[ Editorial comment -The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, instituted a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India on July 1, 2017. It is the Constitution of India’s One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment Bill. GST is a Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed at the national level to be a comprehensive indirect tax levy on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services. It would replace all indirect taxes levied by the Indian Central and state governments on goods and services. It is intended to be comprehensive for the majority of goods and services. In the past, a person was required to pay a significant amount of taxes, including Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty, State VAT, Entertainment Tax, and Entry Tax. The calculation of tax was significantly simplified with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. The Constitution Amendment Bill 122, often known as the 101 Amendment to the Indian Constitution, advocated for the implementation of GST. To prevent tax escalation and establish a single market for goods and services, the goods and services tax will replace numerous indirect taxes levied by the federal and state governments.

Specifically, it added two acts to the schedule: the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 (Kerala Act 35 of 1969) and the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Kerala Act 25 of 1971). However, the legality of the 29th Amendment was challenged in a case brought by a petitioner whose land was subject to seizure under Kerala\\'s Land Reforms. The petitioner also questioned the validity of the 24th and 25th Constitutional Amendments, which they claimed impacted their fundamental rights. This case led to the development of the idea of the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, seven judges out of 13 ruled in favor of upholding the legitimacy of the 29th Amendment, although its validity was not upheld completely.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill, 1951 which was enacted as the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS During the last fifteen months of the working of the Constitution, certain difficulties have been brought to light by judicial decisions and pronouncements specially in regard to the chapter on fundamental rights. The citizen\\'s right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) has been held by some courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence. In other countries with written constitutions, freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring the State from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom. The citizen\\'s right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business conferred by article 19(1)(g) is subject to reasonable restrictions which the laws of the State may impose \"in the interests of general public\". While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of nationalisation which the State may undertake, it is desirable to place the matter beyond doubt by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Another article in regard to which unanticipated difficulties have arisen is article 31. The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legislatures in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of these important measures, affecting large numbers of people, has been held up. The main objects of this Bill are, accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. the opportunity has been taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise. It is laid down in article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be suitably amplified. Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliament have been found necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill. So also a few minor amendments in respect of articles 341, 342, 372 and 376. An Act to amend the Constitution of India Be it enacted by Parliament as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951. 2. Amendment of Article 15.- To Article 15 of the Constitution, the following clause shall be added:- \"(4) Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.\" 3. Amendment of Article 19 and validation of certain laws.- (1) In Article 19 of the Constitution,- (a) for clause (2), the following clause shall be substituted, and the said clause shall be deemed always to have been enacted in the following form, namely:- \"(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.\" (b) in clause (6), for the words beginning with the words \"nothing in the said sub-clause\" and ending with the words \"occupation, trade or business\", the following shall be substituted, namely:- \"nothing in the said sub-clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relating to- (i) the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business, or (ii) the carrying on by the State, or by a corporation owned or controlled by the State, of any trade, business, industry or service, whether to the exclusion, complete or partial, of citizens or otherwise.\" (2) No law in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution which is consistent with the provisions of Article 19 of the Constitution as amended by sub-section (1) of this section shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground only that, being a law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of the said article, its operation was not saved by clause (2) of that article as originally enacted. Explanation.-In this sub-section, the expression \"law in force\" has the same meaning as in clause (1) of Article 13 of the Constitution. 4. Insertion of new Article 31-A.- After Article 31 of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"31-A.

(2) In this article,- (a) the expression \"estate\" shall, in relation to any local area, have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area and shall also include any jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant; (b) the expression \"rights\", in relation to an estate shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub-proprietor, under-proprietor, tenure-holder or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue.\" 5.

Validation of certain Acts and Regulations.- Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article 31-A, none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground that such Act, Regulation or provisions is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or judgment, decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary, each of the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force.\" 6. Amendment of Article 85.- For Article 85 of the Constitution, the following article shall be substituted namely:- \"85. Sessions of Parliament, prorogation and dissolution.- (1) The President shall from time to time summon each House of Parliament to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session. (2) The President may from time to time- (a) prorogue the House or either House; (b) dissolve the House of the People.\" 7. Amendment of Article 87.- In Article 87 of the Constitution,- (1) in clause (1), for the words \"every session\", the words \"the first session after each general election to the House of the People and at the commencement of the first session of each year\" shall be substituted; (2) in clause (2), the words \"and for the precedence of such discussion over other business of the House\" shall be omitted. 8. Amendment of Article 174.- For Article 174 of the Constitution, the following article shall be substituted, namely:- \"174. Sessions of the State Legislature, prorogation and dissolution.- (1) The Governor shall from time to time summon the House or each House of the Legislature of the State to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session. (2) The Governor may from time to time- (a) prorogue the House or either House; (b) dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\" 9. Amendment of Article 176.- In Article 176 of the Constitution- (1) in clause (1), for the words \"every session\" the words \"the first session after each general election to the Legislative Assembly and at the commencement of the first session of each year\" shall be substituted; (2) in clause (2), the words \"and for the precedence of such discussion over other business of the House\" shall be omitted. 10. Amendment of Article 341.- In clause (1) of Article 341 of the Constitution, for the words \"may, after consultation with the Governor or Rajpramukh of a State,\" the words \"may with respect to any State, and where it is a State-specified in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule, after consultation with the Governor or Rajpramukh thereof;\" shall be substituted. 11.

[The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, made several changes to the Fundamental Rights Part of the Indian constitution. It was moved by the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, on 10 May 1951 in Lok Sabha and came into effect on 18 June 1951. The Amendment established a precedent for amending the Constitution to override judicial decisions that prevented the government from carrying out its obligations to specific policies and programs. It amended the Fundamental Rights clauses of the Indian Constitution in several ways. It gave ways to limit freedom of speech and expression in certain issues, supported measures to abolish zamindari, and made it clear that the right to equality does not preclude passing laws that give special consideration to society’s most vulnerable groups. The Statement of Reasons (SOR) relating to the First Amendment said: “Challenges to agrarian laws or laws relating to land reform were pending in courts and were holding up large schemes of land legislation through dilatory and wasteful litigation.” Important Verdicts: Brij Bhushan v State of Delhi, March 1950 , and Romesh Thappar v State of Madras, May 1950 .

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Second Amendment) Bill, 1952 which was enacted as the the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1952 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 81(1)(a) prescribes an absolute limit of 500 elected members in the House of the People. Article 81(1)(b) provides that the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituencies and the number of members to be allotted to each such constituency shall be so determined as to ensure that there shall be not less than one member for every 750,000 of the population and not more than one member for every 500,000 of the population. The present delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is based on the estimates of population which have been given legal validity by an order of the President under article 387 of the Constitution. Article 81(3) of the Constitution, however, requires that upon the completion of each census, the representation of the several territorial constituencies in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of each State shall be re-adjusted by such authority, in such manner and with effect from such date as Parliament may by law determine. A Bill providing for the matters referred to in that article is being introduced in Parliament. Provision has been made in that Bill for the setting up of a Delimitation Commission for the purpose of effecting re-adjustment of the representation in the House of the People and in the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. There is a considerable difference between the population of the several States as estimated in the President\\'s order and in the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. At present, seats have been allotted in the House of the People to Part A and Part B States on the basis of one member for every 7.2 lakhs of the estimated population giving a total of 470 members to these States. The census figures are higher in all cases, and in view of the overall limit of 500 members prescribed in article 81(1) (a), it is not possible to increase appreciably the total number of seats allotted to these States. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the representation from one member for every 7.2 lakhs of population to one member for every 7.5 lakhs of population as per 1951 census. As pointed out above, this figure 7.5 lakhs is the maximum permissible under article 81(1)(b) as it now stands; but even so, if the average population of a Parliamentary constituency in any State is to be 750,000 it is obvious that the population of a certain number of constituencies will exceed that figure. It is necessary, therefore, that article 81(1)(b) should be amended relaxing the limits prescribed in that article so as to avoid a constitutional irregularity in delimiting the constitutencies for the purpose of re-adjustment of representation in the House of the People as required under article 81(3) of the Constitution. This Bill accordingly seeks to amend article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution so as to replace the figures mentioned in that article by the figures 850,000 and 650,000 respectively. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1952. 2. Amendment of article 81.- In sub-clause (b) of clause (1) of article 81 of the Constitution, the words and figures \" not less than one member for every 750,000 of the population and \" shall be omitted. [The Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1952, removed the limit on the maximum population for a parliamentary constituency by amending Article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution. The bill received assent from then President Rajendra Prasad on 1 May 1953, and came into force on the same date but was notified in the Gazette of India on 2 May 1953. According to Article 81(1)(b), the number of representatives to be assigned to every parliamentary constituency must be chosen in a way that ensures the upper population limit for one representative in the lower house of Parliament. The purpose of the measure was to change Article 81 to reduce the maximum population threshold for a parliamentary seat. Also refer ]'}],\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Fourth Amendment) Bill, 1954 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1954 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS This Bill seeks to amend articles 31, 31A and 305 of, and the Ninth Schedule to, the Constitution. 2. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and (2) of article 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same subject. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to property. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It is considered necessary, therefore, to re-state more precisely the State\\'s power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private property and distinguish it from cases where the operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in \"deprivation of property\". This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill. 3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation were attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired lines, e.g., the following:- (i) While the abolition of zamindaris and the numerous intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings. (ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearance of slum areas. (iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State. (iv) It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to secure the better management of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution. (v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another, etc., require to be placed above challenge. It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to cover these categories of essential welfare legislation. 4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is propsed in clause 5 of the Bill to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall within the scope of sub-clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B. 5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It apears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the clear authority of Parliament or of a State Legislature to introduce State monopoly in a particular sphere of trade or commerce, the law might have to be justified before the courts as being \"in the public interest\" under article 301 or as amounting to a \"reasonable restriction\" under article 304(b). It is considered that any such question ought to be left to the final decision of the Legislatue. Clause 4 of the Bill accordingly proposes an amendment of article 305 to make this clear. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Sixth Year of the Republic of India as follow:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Forth Amendment) Act, 1955. 2. Amendment of article 31.- In article 31 of the Constitution, for clause (2), the following clauses shall be substituted, namely:--- \"(2) No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given; and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate. (2A) Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled by the State, it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property, notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property.\". 3. Amendment of article 31A.- In article 31A of the Constitution,-- (a) for clause (1), the following clause shall be, and shall be deemed always to have been, substituted, namely:- \"(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law providing for- (a) the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights, or (b) the taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property, or (c) the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporations, or (d) the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents, secretaries and treasurers, managing directors, directors or managers of corporations, or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof, or (e) the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement, lease or licence for the purpose of searching for, or winning, any mineral or mineral oil, or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement, lease or licence, shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or article 31: Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.\"; and (b) in clause (2),- (i) in sub-clause (a), after the word \"grant\", the words \"and in the States of Madras and Travancore-Cochin, any janman right\" shall be, and shall be deemed always to have been, inserted; and (ii) in sub-clause (b), after the word \"tenure-holder\", the words \"raiyat, under-raiyat\" shall be, and shall be deemed always to have been, inserted. 4. Substitution of new article for article 305.- For article 305 of the Constitution, the following article shall be substituted, namely:- \"305. Saving of existing laws and laws providing for State mono- polies.-Nothing in articles 301 and 303 shall affect the provisions of any existing law except in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct; and nothing in article 301 shall affect the operation of any law made before the commencement of the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, in so far as it relates to, or prevent Parliament or the Legislature of a State from making any law relating to, any such matter as is referred to in sub-clause (ii) of clause (6) of article 19.\". 5. Amendment of the Ninth Schedule.- In the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, after entry 13, the following entries shall be added, namely:--- 14. The Bihar Displaced Persons Rehabilitation (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXXVIII of 1950). 15. The United Provinces Land Acquisition (Rehabilitation of Re- fugees) Act, 1948 (U.P.

The West Bengal Land Development and Planning Act, 1948 (West Bengal Act XXI of 1948), as amended by West Bengal Act XXIX of 1951.\". [The Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, the statement of objects and reasons of the bill aimed to amend Articles 31, 31A and 305 and Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of India. The bill of the 4th amendment of the Indian Constitution was presented on 17 December, 1954 and passed the bill on 27 April, 1955. The amendment modified Article 31(2) to clarify that clauses (1) and (2) address different issues, namely deprivation and compulsory acquisition. The new Article 31(2)(A) specified that compensation was only payable in cases of compulsory acquisition, where the State acquires ownership of the property taken. The adequacy of compensation was also made non-judicial. Additionally, the amendment broadened the scope of Article 31-A and included more statutes in the Ninth Schedule. It also amended Article 305, empowering the State to nationalize any trade. Important Verdicts: State of West Bengal v. Bela banerjee & Saghir Ahmad v. The State of U.P. ]'},\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Second Amendment) Bill, 1952 which was enacted as the the Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1952 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 81(1)(a) prescribes an absolute limit of 500 elected members in the House of the People. Article 81(1)(b) provides that the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituencies and the number of members to be allotted to each such constituency shall be so determined as to ensure that there shall be not less than one member for every 750,000 of the population and not more than one member for every 500,000 of the population. The present delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies is based on the estimates of population which have been given legal validity by an order of the President under article 387 of the Constitution. Article 81(3) of the Constitution, however, requires that upon the completion of each census, the representation of the several territorial constituencies in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of each State shall be re-adjusted by such authority, in such manner and with effect from such date as Parliament may by law determine. A Bill providing for the matters referred to in that article is being introduced in Parliament. Provision has been made in that Bill for the setting up of a Delimitation Commission for the purpose of effecting re-adjustment of the representation in the House of the People and in the State Legislative Assemblies on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. There is a considerable difference between the population of the several States as estimated in the President\\'s order and in the population as ascertained at the census of 1951. At present, seats have been allotted in the House of the People to Part A and Part B States on the basis of one member for every 7.2 lakhs of the estimated population giving a total of 470 members to these States. The census figures are higher in all cases, and in view of the overall limit of 500 members prescribed in article 81(1) (a), it is not possible to increase appreciably the total number of seats allotted to these States. It is accordingly necessary to reduce the representation from one member for every 7.2 lakhs of population to one member for every 7.5 lakhs of population as per 1951 census. As pointed out above, this figure 7.5 lakhs is the maximum permissible under article 81(1)(b) as it now stands; but even so, if the average population of a Parliamentary constituency in any State is to be 750,000 it is obvious that the population of a certain number of constituencies will exceed that figure. It is necessary, therefore, that article 81(1)(b) should be amended relaxing the limits prescribed in that article so as to avoid a constitutional irregularity in delimiting the constitutencies for the purpose of re-adjustment of representation in the House of the People as required under article 81(3) of the Constitution. This Bill accordingly seeks to amend article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution so as to replace the figures mentioned in that article by the figures 850,000 and 650,000 respectively. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Third Amendment) Act 1954. 2. Amendment of the Seventh Schedule.- In the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, for entry 33 of List III, the following entry shall be substituted, namely:- \"33. Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of,- (a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products; (b) foodstuffs, including edible oil seeds and oils; (c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates; (d) raw cotton whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seeds; and (e) raw jute.\". [The Constitution (Third Amendment) Act, 1954, was a significant milestone in the country’s economic development and political evolution. On September 6, 1954, the bill of the 3rd amendment of the Indian Constitution was presented in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha passed the bill on 28 September 1954. The amendment made changes to the Seventh Schedule and widened the scope of Entry 33, List III, which lists the distribution of powers between the central government and the state governments. Thus, empowering Parliament to control the production, supply and distribution of all kinds of commodities. The 3rd Amendment of the Indian constitution was introduced by Article 368, and it was ratified by several state legislatures like West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Saurashtra, Patiala and East Punjab States Union, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Madras.

It was feared that the States could forestall the passage of the State Reorganisation Act by not expressing their views for any length of time.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution Ninth Amendment) Bill, 1956 (Bill No. 29 of 1956) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS In order to implement the scheme of States reorganisation, it is necessary to make numerous amendments in the Constitution with effect from the 1st October, 1956. This bill seeks to make these amendments and also some other amendments to certain provisions of the Constitution relating to the High Courts and High Court Judges, the executive power of the Union and the States, and a few entries in the legislative lists. The reasons for making the amendments are indicated below:- Clause 2.-The reorganisation scheme involves not only the establishment of new States and alterations in the area and boundaries of the existing States, but also the abolition of the three categories of States (Part A, Part B and Part C States) and the classification of certain areas as Union territories. Article 1 has to be suitably amended for this purpose and the First Schedule completely revised. Clause 3.-The amendments proposed in article 80 are formal and consequential. The territorial changes and the formation of new states and Union territories as proposed in Part II of the States Reorganisation Bill, 1956, involve a complete revision of the Fourth Schdule to the Constitution by which the seats in the Council of States are allocated to the existing States. The present allocation is made on the basis of the population of each State as ascertained at the census of 1941 and the number of seats allotted to each Part A and Part B State is according to the formula, one seat per million for the first five millions and one seat for every additional two millions or part thereof exceeding one million. It is proposed to revise the allocation of seats on the basis of the latest census figures, but according to the same formula as before. Clause 4.-The abolition of Part C States as such and the establishment of Union territories make extensive amendment of articles 81 and 82 inevitable. The provision in article 81(1)(b) that \"the States shall be divided, grouped or formed into territorial constituencies\" will no longer be appropriate, since after reorganisation each of the States will be large enough to be divided into a number of constituencies and will not permit of being grouped together with other States for this purpose or being \"formed\" into a single territorial constituency. Clause (2) of article 81 and article 82 will require to be combined and revised in order to make suitable provision for Union territories. Instead of amending the articles piecemeal, it is proposed to revise and simplify them. Incidentally, it is proposed in clause (1)(b) of the revised article 81 to fix a maximum for the total number of representatives that may be assigned to the Union territories by Parliament. Clause 5.-The proposed revision of the proviso to article 131 is consequential on the disappearance of Part B States as such. The two parts of the existing proviso have been combined. Clause 6.-Article 153 provides that there shall be a Governor for each State. Since it may be desirable in certain circumstances to appoint a Governor for two or more States, it is proposed to add a proviso to this article to remove any possible technical bar to such an appointment. Clause 7.-Sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of article 168 provides for bi-cameral legislatures in certain States. It is proposed that, among the reorganised States, Punjab and Mysore should continue to have such a legislature, and that the enlarged Madhya Pradesh should also be provided with one. Since the constitution of a Legislative Council for Madhya Pradesh will necessarily take time, it is proposed to bring the relevant amendment of article 168(1)(a) into force from a future date by means of a public notification of the President. Clause 8.-This seeks to revise article 170 mainly with a view to bringing it into line with articles 81 and 82 as revised by clause 4. Clause 9.-Under clause (1) of article 171, the maximum strength of the Legislative Council of a State is fixed at one-fourth of the strength of the Legislative Assembly of that State. Although in the larger States, like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, this maximum is adequate, it leads to difficulties in the case of the smaller States. It is, therefore, proposed to alter the maximum to one-third of the strength of the Legislative Assembly. Clause 10.-Article 216 empowers the President to appoint to a High Court as many judges as he may from time to time deem it necessary and also to fix the maximum number of judges for each High Court by a separate order. The proviso is of little significance from the practical point of view, since the order fixing the maximum may be changed by the President whenever necessary. The appointment of additional and acting judges for which provision is sought to be made in clause 14 will also involve either frequent modifications in the order or a fixation of the maximum number at a high figure. It is, therefore, proposed to omit the proviso to article 216. Clause 11.-The amendment of clause (1) of article 217 proposed in this clause is consequential on the proposal to provide for the appointment of additional and acting judges for limited periods. Clause 12.-An important factor affecting the selection of High Court judges from the bar is the total prohibition contained in article 220 on practice after their retirement from the bench. It is proposed to revise the article so as to relax this complete ban and permit a retired judge to practise in the Supreme Court and in any High Court other than the one in the which he was a permanent judge. Clause 13.-Article 222 empowers the President to transfer judges from one High Court to another. Clause (2) of this article goes on to provide that when a judge is so transferred he shall be entitled to receive in addition to his salary a compensatory allowance. It is felt that there is no real justification for granting such an allowance and it is accordingly proposed to omit clause (2). Clause 14.-The provision in article 224 for recalling retired judges to function on the bench of a High Court for short periods has been found to be neither adequate nor satisfactory. It is, therefore, proposed to replace this article by a provision for the appointment of additional judges to clear off arrears and for the appointment of acting judges in temporary vacancies. Clause 15.-It is proposed to revise and simplify articles 230, 231 and 232 having regard to the constitutional position of States and Union territories after reorganisation. While under article 214 there will normally be a separate High Court for each State, power will be required to establish common High Courts for two or more States. Power will also be required to extend the jurisdiction of a High Court to a Union territory, wherever necessary, and to exclude the jurisdiction of a High Court from such territory. The revised articles 230 and 231 are designed to make these provisions. Clause 16.-Part VIII of the Constitution provides for the administration of Part C States and Part IX for the administration of Part D territories. It is proposed to amend Part VIII to provide for the administration of Union territories and to repeal Part IX. Clause 17.-While the President is empowered by article 258 (1) to entrust Union functions to a State Government or its officers, there is no corresponding provision enabling the Governor of a State to entrust State functions to the Central Government or its officers. This lacuna has been found to be of practical consequence in connection with the execution of certain development projects in the States. It is proposed to fill the lacuna by a new article 258A. Clause 18.-Article VIII of the Covenant entered into by the Rulers of Travancore and Cochin in May, 1949, for the formation of the United State of Travancore and Cochin provided that Travancore\\'s obligation to contribute annually a sum of Rs. 51 lakhs to the Travancore Devaswom Fund should continue as an obligation of the United State. This arrangement was confirmed by article 238(10) (ii) of the Constitution. It is proposed that the existing arrangement should be continued even after the formation of the new State of Kerala , but the contribution to the Travancore Devaswom Board from the Consolidated Fund of that State should, in view of the transfer of territory from Travancore-Cochin to Madras, be reduced from Rs. 51 lakhs to Rs. 46.5 lakhs. Clause 19.-In this clause it is proposed to revise and amplify the scope of article 298, mainly to make it clear that Union Government, as well as the State Governments, are competent to carry on any commercial or industrial undertaking, whether or not it is related to a matter within the legislative competence of the Union, or, as the case may be, of the State. Similarly , the holding, acquisition and disposal of property and the making of contracts by the Union or a State could be for any purpose without constitutional impropriety. At the same time, the revised article provides that this extended executive power of the Union and of the States will be subject, in the former case, to legislation by the State, and in the latter case, to legislation by Parliament. Clause 20.-The new article 350A proposed in this clause is designed to implement one of the States Reorganisation Commission\\'s important recommendations regarding safeguards for linguistic minorities in the States after reorganisation. Clause 21.-It is proposed to replace article 371 by another article making a special provision with respect to the States of Andhra and Punjab. This article will enable the President to constitute regional committees of the State Legislative Assembly and secure their proper functioning by directing suitable modifications to be made in the rules of business of Government and in the rules of procedure of the Assembly. Clause 22.-The High Court of Travancore-Cochin will, as from the appointed day, become the High Court for the new State of Kerala and the High Courts of Mysore and Rajasthan will continue, respectively, as the High Courts for the enlarged \"new\" States with the same names. Taking into account the level of income at the bar and salaries payable to the judicial services in these States, it is considered that there is no need to increase the salaries payable to the Judges of these High Courts to the level of the other High Courts. It is proposed to amend sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 10 of the Second Schedule to the Constitution providing for a salary of Rs. 3,000 to the Chief Justices, and Rs. 2,500 to the other Judges, of these three High Courts. Sometimes it becomes necessary to appoint a retired district judge as a judge of a High Court . In the absence of a legal provision for withholding the pension due to such a judge, it has been the practise to obtain from him an undertaking that he would not claim the pension for the period for which he serves as a High Court judge. Since this is obviously unsatisfactory, it is proposed to add a proviso to paragraph 10(1) of the Second Schedule on the same lines as the proviso to paragraph 9(1) thereof regulating the salary of a judge of the Supreme Court in similar circumstances. Sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph 10 are no longer required, since appropriate provision has been made in the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Ace, 1954. Clause 23.-The existence of three entries in the legislative lists (33 of List I, 36 of List II and 42 of List III) relating to the essentially single subject of acquisition and requisitioning of property by the Government gives rise to unnecessary technical difficulties in legislation. In order to avoid these difficulties and simplify the constitutional position, it is proposed to omit the entries in the Union and State List and replace the entry in the Concurrent List by a comprehensive entry covering the whole subject. Clause 24.-Entry 67 of the Union List refers to \"ancient and historical monuments and records, and archaeological sites and remains ,declared by Parliament by law to be of national importance\". A large number of ancient monuments, archaeological sites, etc., have been declared to be of national importance by an Act of Parliament. It requires another Act of Parliament to make the slightest alteration in, or addition to, the lists in that Act, which seems to be and unduly cumbrous procedure. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the entry substituting for the words \"declared by Parliament by law\", the words \"declared by or under law made by Parliament\". The same amendment is also proposed to be made in the connected provisions, entry 12 of the State List, entry 40 of the Concurrent List and article 49. Clause 25.-Although the Union List has two entries 7 and 52, relating to industries, the latter alone is referred to in entry 24 of List II. The omission of entry 7 of List I appears to be due to an oversight and is sought to be rectified in this clause. Clause 26 and the Schedule.-These contain the consequential and minor amendments and repeals proposed to be made in the Constitution and in the Constitution (Removal of Difficulties) Order No. VIII pertaining to the Assam tribal areas. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India Be it enacted by Parliament in the Seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956. (2) It shall come into force on the 1st day of November, 1956. 2. Amendment of Article 1 and First Schedule.- (1) In Article 1 of the Constitution,- (a) for clause (2), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:- \"(2) The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule.\"; and (b) in clause (3), for sub-clause (b), the following sub-clause shall be substituted, namely:- \"(b) the Union Territories specified in the First Schedule; and\". (2) For the First Schedule to the Constitution as amended by the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, and the Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act, 1956, the following Schedule shall be substituted, namely:- FIRST SCHEDULE (Articles 1 and 4) Name Territories I.

[ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, was enacted to make way for the States Reorganisation Act 1956. The Act\\'s provisions required changes to be made to various articles of the Indian Constitution. It modified the articles in the First Schedule to establish new boundaries for different states. The Fourth Schedule was also modified to allocate seats in the Council of States to the existing states. Previously, seats were allocated based on the formula of one seat per million for the first five million, and one seat for every additional two million or part thereof exceeding one million, according to the population of each state in Part-A and Part-B. Additionally, changes were made to other provisions related to the governor\\'s powers and Legislative Councils in order to facilitate proper governance of the new states. The main purpose of the Act was the reorganization of states, and the other ancillary modifications were made to support this objective. Also Refer ]'},\n",

As  regards   the  boundary between  West  Bengal  and East Pakistan in the  areas  of   Mahananda, Burung and Karatoa rivers, It was agreed that demarcation will be made in  accordance  with  the latest cadastral survey  maps   supported  by relevant notifications and record-of-rights. 6. Assam-East Pakistan Boundary. (i) The  dispute  concerning  Bagge Award III  has  been  settled  by adopting  the  following  rational  boundary in  the   Patharia  Forest Reserve region: From a point marked X (H522558) along the Radcliffe Line BA on the old Patharia  Reserve Boundary as shown in the topographical map sheet No. 83D/5,  the boundary line shall run in close proximity and parallel to the  cart  road  to  its south to a point A (H531554);    thence  in  a southerly  direction  up  the spur and along the ridge to a  hill   top marked  B  (H523529);  thence in a south-easterly direction along  the ridge  down the spur across a stream to a hill top marked C (H532523); thence  in a southerly direction to a point D (H530517);  thence in  a south-westerly  direction  to  a flat top E (H523507);   thence   in  a southerly   direction   to  a  point  F   (H524500);    thence   in   a south-easterly direction in a straight line to the mid-stream point of the  Gandhai  Nala  marked  G  (H540494);   thence   in  south-westerly direction  up  the  mid-stream of Gandhai Nala to point  H   (H533482); thence  in a south-westerly direction up a spur and along the ridge to a  point  I (H517460);  thence in a southerly direction to a point  on the  ridge  marked J (H518455);  thence in a south-westerly  direction along  the  ridge to a point height 364 then continues along the  same direction  along the same ridge to a point marked K (H500428);  thence in  a  south  and south-westerly direction along the same ridge  to   a point marked L (H496420);  thence in a south- easterly direction along the  same  ridge  to  a  point   marked  M   (H499417);   thence  in  a south-westerly direction along the ridge to a point on the bridle path with  a  height  587;   then  up the spur to the  hill   top  marked  N (H487393);  then in a south-easterly and southerly direction along the ridge  to  the  hill  top  with height 692;   thence   in  a  southerly direction  down the spur to a point on Buracherra marked O  (H484344); thence  in  a south-westerly direction up the spur along the ridge  to the  trigonometrical  survey  station with height 690;   thence   in  a southerly  direction along the ridge to a point height 490  (H473292); thence in a straight line due south to a point on the eastern boundary of  the  Patharia  Reserve  Forest  marked  Y   (H473263);   along  the Radcliffe Line BA The  line  described  above  has   been   plotted  on  two  copies   of topographical map sheets Nos.  83D/5, 83D/6 and 83D/2. The technical experts responsible for the ground demarcation will have the  authority to make minor adjustments in order to make the boundary alignment agree with the physical features as described. The  losses  and  gains  to   either  country  as  a  result  of  these adjustments  with  respect  to  the line marked on  the  map   will  be balanced by the technical experts. 3. EXTRACTS  FROM  THE   AGREEMENT  ENTITLED  \"AGREED  DECISIONS  AND PROCEDURES  TO END DISPUTES AND INCIDENTS ALONG THE INDO-WEST PAKISTAN BORDER AREAS\", DATED THE 11TH DAY OF JANUARY, 1960. 1. West  Pakistan-Punjab  border.-Of the total of 325 miles  of  the border  in this sector, demarcation has been completed along about 252 miles.   About 73 miles of the border has not yet been demarcated  due to differences between the Governments of India and Pakistan regarding interpretation  of  the  decision  and Award of  the  Punjab   Boundary Commission  presented  by  Sir  Cyril Radcliffe  as   Chairman  of  the Commission.  These differences have been settled along the lines given below in a spirit of accommodation: (i) The Sarja Marja, Rakh Hardit Singh and Pathanke (Amritsar- Lahore border).-The Governments of India and Pakistan agree that the boundary between  West-Pakistan and India in the this region should follow  the boundary  between  the Tehsils of Lahore and Kasur as laid down  under Punjab  Government  Notification  No.  2183-E, dated 2nd  June,   1939. These  three villages will in consequence, fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Government of Pakistan. (iv) Suleimanke  (Ferozepur-Montgomery   border).-The  Governments  of India  and  Pakistan agree to adjust the district boundaries  in  this region  as specified in the attached Schedule and as shown in the  map appended thereto as Annexure I. [The Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Act, 1960, clarified the extent of Parliament’s power to reduce the area of a state and addressed the issue of ceding Indian territory to foreign nations. In accordance with the Indo-Pakistan Agreement of 1958, the amendment made it easier for India to cede the land of the Berubari Union to Pakistan. However, the West Bengal government did not agree to the agreement, and the matter was subsequently taken to the Supreme Court. The court declared that the transfer of Indian territory to a foreign country was not within Parliament’s authority to reduce a state’s area, as outlined in Article 3 of the Indian Constitution. Nonetheless, the amendment helped to resolve conflicts by redrawing the boundaries and adjusting the territorial claims of each state.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to THE CONSTITUTION (Fourth Amendment) Bill, 1954 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1954 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS This Bill seeks to amend articles 31, 31A and 305 of, and the Ninth Schedule to, the Constitution. 2. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have given a very wide meaning to clauses (1) and (2) of article 31. Despite the difference in the wording of the two clauses, they are regarded as dealing with the same object. The deprivation of property referred to in clause (1) is to be construed in the widest sense as including any curtailment of a right to property. Even where it is caused by a purely regulatory provision of law and is not accompanied by an acquisition or taking possession of that or any other property right by the State, the law, in order to be valid according to these decisions, has to provide for compensation under clause (2) of the article. It is considered necessary, therefore, to re-state more precisely the State\\'s power of compulsory acquisition and requisitioning of private property and distinguish it from cases where the operation of regulatory or prohibitory laws of the State results in \"deprivation of property\". This is sought to be done in clause 2 of the Bill. 3. It will be recalled that the zamindari abolition laws which came first in our programme of social welfare legislation were attacked by the interests affected mainly with reference to articles 14, 19 and 31, and that in order to put an end to the dilatory and wasteful litigation and place these laws above challenge in the courts, articles 31A and 31B and the Ninth Schedule were enacted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act. Subsequent judicial decisions interpreting articles 14, 19 and 31 have raised serious difficulties in the way of the Union and the States putting through other and equally important social welfare legislation on the desired lines, e.g., the following:- (i) While the abolition of zamindari system and the numerous intermediaries between the State and the tiller of the soil has been achieved for the most part, our next objectives in land reform are the fixing of limits to the extent of agricultural land that may be owned or occupied by any person, the disposal of any land held in excess of the prescribed maximum and the further modification of the rights of land owners and tenants in agricultural holdings. (ii) The proper planning of urban and rural areas require the beneficial utilisation of vacant and waste lands and the clearance of slum areas. (iii) In the interest of national economy the State should have full control over the mineral and oil resources of the country, including in particular, the power to cancel or modify the terms and conditions of prospecting licenses, mining leases and similar agreements. This is also necessary in relation to public utility undertakings which supply power, light or water to the public under licenses granted by the State. (iv) It is often necessary to take over under State management for a temporary period a commercial or industrial undertaking or other property in the public interest or in order to secure the better management of the undertaking or property. Laws providing for such temporary transference to State management should be permissible under the Constitution. (v) The reforms in company law now under contemplation, like the progressive elimination of the managing agency system, provision for the compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies in the national interest, the transfer of an undertaking from one company to another, etc., require to be placed above challenge. It is accordingly proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to extend the scope of article 31A so as to cover these categories of essential welfare legislation. 4. As a corollary to the proposed amendment of article 31A, it is proposed in clause 5 of the Bill to include in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution two more State Acts and four Central Acts which fall within the scope of sub-clauses (d) and (f) of clause (1) of the revised article 31A. The effect will be their complete, retrospective validation under the provisions of article 31B. 5. A recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Saghir Ahmed v. the State of U.P. has raised the question whether an Act providing for a State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce guaranteed by article 301, but left the question undecided. Clause (6) of article 19 was amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act in order to take such State monopolies out of the purview of sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of that article, but no corresponding provision was made in Part XIII of the Constitution with reference to the opening words of article 301. It appears from the judgment of the Supreme Court that notwithstanding the clear authority of Parliament or of a State Legislature to introduce State monopoly in a particular sphere of trade or commerce, the law might have to be justified before the courts as being \"in the public interest\" under article 301 or as amounting to a \"reasonable restriction\" under article 304(b). It is considered that any such question ought to the final decision of the Legislatue. Clause 4 of the Bill accordingly proposes an amendment of article 305 to make this clear. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Tenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:--- 1. Short  title.- This  Act may be called  the  Constitution  (Eighth Amendment) Act, 1959. 2. Amendment of article 334.- In article 334 of the Constitution, for the words \"ten years\" the words \"twenty years\" shall be substituted. [The Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act, 1959, which changed Article 334 of the Constitution, is an important milestone in Indian history. The amendment to Article 334 of the Constitution extended the period of reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and representation of the Anglo-Indians in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies by ten years, until 26 January 1970. Article 334 had stipulated that the reservation of seats should expire within ten years from the commencement of the Constitution (i.e. 26 January 1960). However, the extension of the reservation was necessary to provide these marginalized communities with greater opportunities to participate in the political process and have their voices heard. Subsequent amendments further extended the period of reservation to 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, and 2030 through the 23rd, 45th, 62nd, 79th, 95th, and 104th Amendments, respectively.

In deference to the desire and request of the people of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli for integration of their territories with the Union of India, the Government of India have decided that these territories should form part of the Union of India. It is proposed to specify these areas expressly as the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli by amending the First Schedule to the Constitution. It is further proposed to amend clause (1) of article 240 of the Constitution to include therein the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in order to enable the President to make regulations for the peace, progress and good government of the territory. The Bill seeks to give effect to these proposals. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twelfth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) Act, 1961. (2) It shall be deemed to have come into force on the 11th day of August, 1961. 2. Amendment of the First Schedule to the Constitution.- In the First Schedule to the Constitution, under the heading \"THE UNION TERRITORIES\", after entry 6, the following entry shall be inserted, namely:- \"7. Dadra and Nagar Haveli: The territory which immediately before the eleventh day of August, 1961 was comprised in Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\". 3. Amendment of article 240.- In article 240 of the Constitution, in clause (1), after entry (b), the following entry shall be inserted, namely:- \"(c) Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\". [The Constitution (Tenth Amendment) Act, 1961, incorporated Dadra and Nagar Haveli as the seventh Union territory of India, by amending the First Schedule to the Constitution. It also amended clause (1) of article 240 of the Constitution to include the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in order to enable the President to “make regulations for the peace, progress and good government of the territory”.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Eleventh Amendment) Bill, 1961 which was enacted as the Constitution (Eleventh Amendment) Act, 1961 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 1. Under article 66(1) of the Constitution, the Vice-President has to be elected by members of both Houses of Parliament assembled at a joint meeting. The requirement that members of the two Houses should assemble at a joint sitting for the election of the Vice-President seems to be totally unnecessary and may also cause practical difficulties. It is, therefore, proposed to amend this article to provide that the Vice-President will be elected by members of an electoral college consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament. Under article 54 of the Constitution, the President is elected by an electoral college consisting of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament and of the Legislative Assemblies of the States. Every effort is made to complete such elections before the date of the Presidential election. It is, however, possible that the elections to the two Houses of Parliament may not be completed before the President or the Vice-President is elected. It is, therefore, proposed to amend article 7 1 of the Constitution so as to make it clear that the election of the President or the Vice-President cannot be challenged on the ground of any vacancy for any reason in the appropriate electoral college. 2. The Bill seeks to achieve these objects. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill explain the provisions thereof. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twelfth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Eleventh Amendment) Act, 1961. (2) Amendment of article 66.- In article 66 of the Constitution, in clause (1), for the words \"members of both Houses of Parliament assembled at a joint meeting\", the words \"members of an electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament\" shall be substituted. 3. Amendment of article 71.- In article 71 of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(4) The election of a person as President or Vice-President shall not be called in question on the ground of the existence of any vacancy for whatever reason among the members of the electoral college electing him.\". [The Constitution (Eleventh Amendment) Act, 1961, eliminates the need for members of both Houses of Parliament to meet in person to elect the Vice-President. Instead, a new electoral college comprising members from both Houses was created to carry out the election process. This change, which added a new clause (4) to Article 71 of the Constitution, represents an important step towards democratization and inclusivity in the Indian political system. By making the process more efficient and streamlined, the amendment enhances the functioning of the electoral process for the Vice-President. Also refer ]'}],\n",

This Bill provides for these territories being specified in the Constitution itself as a Union territory called \\'Pondicherry\\'. Under article 81(1)(b) of the Constitution, not more than twenty members are to represent the Union territories in the House of the People. This maximum has already been reached. The Bill accordingly seeks to increase this number to twenty-five to enable representation being given immediately to Pondicherry in the House of the People and to provide for future contingencies. The Bill also provides for representation of the territory in the Council of States. It is proposed to create Legislatures and Councils of Ministers in the Union territories of Himanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Goa, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry broadly on the pattern of the scheme which was in force in some of the Part C States before the reorganisation of the States. The Bill seeks to confer necessary legislative power on Parliament to enact laws for this purpose through a new article 239A which follows generally the provisions of article 240 as it stood before the reorganisation of the States.

(2) Any such law as is referred to in clause (1) shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of article 368 notwithstanding that it contains any provision which amends or has the effect of amending this Constitution.\". 5. Amendment of article 240.- In article 240 of the Constitution, in clause (1),- (a) after entry (d), the following entry shall be inserted, namely:- \"(e) Pondicherry:\"; (b) the following proviso shall be inserted at the end, namely:- \"Provided that when any body is created under article 239A to function as a Legislature for the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu or Pondicherry, the President shall not make any regulation for the peace, progress and good government of that Union territory with effect from the date appointed for the first meeting of the Legislature.\". 6.

The French colonies of Pondicherry, Mahé, Yanam, and Karikal officially became part of the Indian Union on August 16, 1962, following the ratification of the Treaty of Cession by France and India. Additionally, this amendment granted Parliament the power to enact laws for creating legislatures and a council of ministers for certain union territories, namely Puducherry, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Daman and Diu, and Manipur. It involved changes to sections 81 and 240 and the First and Fourth Schedules to the Constitution. Furthermore, a new article 239A was proposed to be added to the Constitution. Also refer ]'},\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Bill, 1962 which was enacted as the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Several amendments to the Constitution have been under consideration for a long time. The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in November, 1955, to give effect to some of them. For various reasons, the Bill could not be proceeded with, and it was allowed to lapse except the one relating to the amendment of article 3 of the Constitution. This article was amended separately by the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Act, 1955. The present Bill contains some of the proposals included in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill and, in addition, there are a few more proposals for amendment of the Constitution. The proposals relating to articles 276, 297, 311, and 316 of the Constitution were contained in the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill and they have been adopted with some minor modifications. The new proposals relate to articles 124, 128, 217, 220, 222, 224A, 226 and entry 78 of the Union List. 2. It is proposed to amend article 217 so as to raise the age of retirement of High Court Judges from sixty years to sixty-two years. When any question arises to the correct age of a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court, the question has to be decided by the President. It is proposed to make the position clear by making a specific provision in articles 124 and 217. It is considered desirable in the public interest that Judges should be transferred from one High Court to another. Such transfer is expected to impose additional financial burden on the Judge who is so transferred. It is, therefore, proposed to pay him some compensatory allowance in addition to his salary. When a Judge is transferred from one High Court to another, he cannot, in view of the provisions of article 220, resume practice in any of the High Courts in which he has held office as a Judge. The provisions of article 220 therefore put a check on the proposal for the transfer of any Judge of a High Court. It is, therefore, propose d to amend article 220 so that the restriction regarding resumption of practice should apply only to the High Court from which the Judge retires, provided that he had served in that High Court for a period of at least five years immediately before retirement. Such a provision would facilitate the transfer of Judges. Under the existing article 226 of the Constitution, the only High Court which has jurisdiction with respect to the Central Government is the Punjab High Court. This involves considerable hardship to litigants from distant places. It is, therefore, proposed to amend article 226 so that when any relief is sought against any Government, authority or person for any action taken, the High Court within whose jurisdiction the cause of action arise may also have jurisdiction to issue appropriate directions, orders or writs. The other new proposals are of a minor character. 3. The notes on clauses appended to the Bill explain the provisions thereof. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India Be it enacted by Parliament in the Fourteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963. 2. Amendment of Article 124.- In Article 124 of the Constitution, after clause (2), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(2-A) The age of a Judge of the Supreme Court shall be determined by such authority and in such manner as Parliament may by law provide.\". 3. Amendment of Article 128.- In Article 128 of the Constitution, after the words \"Federal Court\", the words \"or who has held the office of a Judge of a High Court and is duly qualified for appointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court\" shall be inserted. 4. Amendment of Article 217.- In Article 217 of the Constitution,- (a) in clause (1), for the words \"sixty years\", the words \"sixty-two years\" shall be substituted; (b) after clause (2), the following clause shall be inserted and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(3) If any question arises as to the age of a Judge of a High Court, the question shall be decided by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the decision of the President shall be final.\". 5. Amendment of Article 222.- In Article 222 of the Constitution, after clause (1), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(2) When a Judge has been or is so transferred, he shall, during the period he serves, after the commencement of the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, as a Judge of the other High Court, be entitled to receive in addition to his salary such compensatory allowance as may be determined by Parliament by law and, until so determined, such compensatory allowance as the President may by order fix.\" 6. Amendment of Article 224.- In Article 224 of the Constitution, in clause (3) for the words \"sixty years\", the words \"sixty-two years\" shall be substituted. 7. Insertion of new Article 224-A.- After Article 224 of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- \"224-A. Appointment of retired Judges at sittings of High Courts.-Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Chief Justice of a High Court for any State may at any time, with the previous consent of the President, request any person who has held the office of a Judge of that Court or of any other High Court to sit and act as a Judge of the High Court for that State, and every such person so requested shall, while so sitting and acting, be entitled to such allowances as the President may by order determine and have all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of, but shall not otherwise be deemed to be, a Judge of that High Court: Provided that nothing in this article shall be deemed to require any such person as aforesaid to sit and act as a Judge of that High Court unless he consents so to do.\". 8. Amendment of Article 226.- In Article 226 of the Constitution,- (a) after clause (1), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(1-A) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority or person may also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence of such person is not within those territories.\"; (b) in clause (2), for the word, brackets and figure \"clause (1)\", the words, brackets, figures and letter \"clause (1) or clause (1-A)\" shall be substituted. 9. Amendment of Article 297.- In Article 297 of the Constitution, after the words \"territorial waters\", the words \"or the continental shelf\" shall be inserted. 10. Amendment of Article 311.- In Article 311 of the Constitution, for clauses (2) and (3) the following clauses shall be substituted, namely:- \"(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him and given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges and where it is proposed, after such inquiry, to impose on him any such penalty, until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed, but only on the basis of the evidence adduced during such inquiry: Provided that this clause shall not apply- (a) where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or (b) where the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by that authority in writing, it is not reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry; or (c) where the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to hold such inquiry. (3) If, in respect of any such person as aforesaid, a question arises whether it is reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry as is referred to in clause (2), the decision thereon of the authority empowered to dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank shall be final.\" 11. Amendment of Article 316.- In Article 316 of the Constitution, after clause (1), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(1-A) If the office of the Chairman of the Commission becomes vacant or if any such Chairman is by reason of absence or for any other reason unable to perform the duties of his office those duties shall, until some person appointed under clause (1) to the vacant office has entered on the duties thereof or, as the case may be, until the Chairman has, resumed his duties, be performed by such one of the other members of the Commission as the President, in the case of the Union Commission or a Joint Commission, and the Governor of the State in the case of a State Commission, may appoint for the purpose.\" 12. Amendment of the Seventh Schedule.- In the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, in List I, in entry 78, after the word \"organisation\", the brackets and words \"(including vacations)\" shall be inserted and shall be deemed always to have been inserted. [The Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, enabled the High Court to issue writs to any person or authority even outside the jurisdiction of its terrorist if the cause of action arises within its territorial boundaries. The High Court judge’s age of retirement was changed under Article 217. Judges should be moved from one High Court to another, only if it is deemed to be in the public’s interest and by consensus. The Judge who is so transferred might anticipate facing an increased financial burden as a result of this move. So, according to new clause (2) of Article 222, judges who are transferred from one High court to another must get compensation. Also Refer ]'},\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Nineteenth Amendment) Bill, 1964 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 31A of the Constitution provides that a law in respect of the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or article 31. The protection of this article is available only in respect of such tenures as were estates on the 26th January, 1950, when the Constitution came into force. The expression \"estate\" has been defined differently in different States and, as a result of the transfer of land from one State to another on account of the reorganisation of States, the expression has come to be defined differently in different parts of the same State. Moreover, many of the land reform enactments relate to lands which are not included in an estate. Several State Acts relating to land reform were struck down on the ground that the provisions of those Acts were violative of articles 14, 19 and 31 of the Constitution and that the protection of article 31A was not available to them. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the definition of \"estate\" in article 31A of the Constitution by including therein, lands held under ryotwari settlement and also other lands in respect of which provisions are normally made in land reform enactments. It is further proposed to provide that where any law makes a provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate not less than the market value thereof. 2. It is also proposed to amend the Ninth Schedule by including therein certain State enactments relating to land reform in order to remove any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to their validity. 3. The Bill seeks to achieve these objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifteenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called THE CONSTITUTION (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964. 2. Amendment of article 31A.- In article 31A of the Constitution,- (i) in clause (1), after the existing proviso, the following proviso shall be inserted, namely:- \"Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure, provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof.\"; (ii) in clause (2), for sub-clause (a), the following sub-clause shall be substituted and shall be deemed always to have been substituted, namely:- `(a) the expression \"estate\" shall, in relation to any local area, have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area and shall also include- (i) any jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant and in the States of Madras and Kerala, any janmam right; (ii) any land held under ryotwari settlement; (iii) any land held or let for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, including waste land, forest land, land for pasture or sites of buildings and other structures occupied by cultivators of land, agricultural labourers and village artisans;\\'. 3.

In another judgment, the Supreme Court had held that the power of posting of a district judge under article 233 does not include the power of transfer of such judge from one station to another and that the power of transfer of a district judge is vested in the High Court under article 235 of the Constitution. As a result of these judgments, a serious situation has arisen because doubt has been thrown on the validity of the judgments, decrees, orders and sentences passed or made by these district judges and a number of writ petitions and other cases have already been filed challenging their validity. The functioning of the district courts in Uttar Pradesh has practically come to a standstill. It is, therefore, urgently necessary to validate the judgments, decrees, orders and sentences passed or made heretofore by all such district judges in those States and also to validate the appointment, posting, promotion and transfer of such district judges barring those few who were not eligible for appointment under article 233. 2.

If the proposal for a legislation to amend the Representation of the People Act, 1951, containing, inter alia, provisions for the trial of election petitions by High Courts instead of the election tribunals, as at present, is accepted by Parliament, it would be necessary to make a minor amendment in clause (1) of article 324 of the Constitution for the purpose of deleting therefrom the words \",including the appointment of election tribunals for the decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with elections to Parliament and to the Legislatures of States\".

Before the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, was enacted, the expression \"States\" occurring in that article meant Part A States, Part B States and also Part C States. By the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution in 1956, the concept of \"Union territories\" was introduced in our Constitution but article 3 was not amended to include in terms \"Union territories\". It is considered proper to amend this article to make it clear that \"State\" in clauses (a) to (e) of that article (but not in the proviso) includes \"Union territories\". It is also considered proper to make it clear that power under clause (a) of article 3 includes power to form a new State or Union territory by uniting a part of a State or Union territory to another State or Union territory. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Seventeenth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1.

Explanation II.-The power conferred on Parliament by clause (a) includes the power to form a new State or Union territory by uniting a part of any State or Union territory to any other State or Union territory. [The Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 1966, revised Article 3 of the Constitution to give new meaning to the terms “State” and “Union territories”. The modification clarified that in Article 3, the term “State” in clauses (a) to (e) must include “Union territories”. However, this was not applicable in the proviso. It further explained that the power under clause (a) involves the authority of the Parliament for the formation of a new State or Union territory. This may be done by joining a part of any State or Union territory with some other State or Union territory. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution was concerned with the establishment of new States. It also provided for altering names, areas, or boundaries of existing States. Hence, it needed modification to include the concept of “Union territories” within the meaning of “State” in clauses (a) to (e), but not in the proviso. This would allow the reorganization of Union territories. Therefore, this amendment was crucial for the formation and rise of Union territories. Also refer ]'}],\n",

Although the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have made considerable progress in the last twenty years, the reasons which weighed with the Constituent Assembly in making provisions with regard to the aforesaid reservation of seats and nomination of members, have not cheapest to exist. It is, therefore, proposed to continue the reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the representation of Anglo-Indians by nomination for a further period of ten years. 2. More than ninety per cent. of the population of the State of Nagaland, which came into being in 1963, in tribal. It would be anomalous to make revision for reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Legislatures in the States where they are in a majority. It is, therefore, proposed, as desired by the Government of Nagaland, not to make any reservation for the Scheduled Tribes in Nagaland either in the House of the People or in the State Legislative Assembly. Articles 330 and 332 of the Constitution are being amended for this purpose. 3. Under article 333 of the Constitution, the number of Anglo-Indians, who may be nominated to the State Legislative Assemblies, is left to the discretion of the Governor. It is now proposed to amend that article so as to provide that not more than one Anglo-Indian should be nominated by the Governor to any State Legislative Assembly. This amendment will not however affect representation of the Anglo-Indian community in the existing Legislative Assemblies until their dissolution. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twentieth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-third Amendment) Act, 1969. 2. Amendment of article 330.- In article 330 of the Constitution, in sub-clause (b) of clause (1), for the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam\", the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam and in Nagaland\" shall be substituted. 3. Amendment of article 332- In article 332 of the Constitution, in clause (1), for the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam\", the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam and in Nagaland\" shall be substituted. 4. Amendment of article 333- (1) In article 333 of the Constitution, for the words \"nominate such number of members of the community to the Assembly as he considers appropriate\", the words \"nominate one member of that community to the Assembly\" shall be substituted. (2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1)shall affect any representation of the Anglo-Indian community in the Legislative Assembly of any State existing at the commencement of this Act until the dissolution of that Assembly. 5. Amendment of article 334- In article 334 of the Constitution, for the words \"twenty years\", the words \"thirty years\" shall be substituted. [The Constitution (Twenty-Three Amendment) Act, 1969, discontinued reservation of seats for the Scheduled Tribes in Nagaland, both in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assembly and stipulated that not more than one Anglo-Indian could be nominated by the Governor to any State Legislative Assembly. Prior to the amendment, the number of Anglo-Indians who could be nominated to the State Legislative Assemblies was left to the discretion of the Governor of the State. The amendment also extended the period of reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and representation of the Anglo-Indians in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies for another ten years, i.e. up to 26 January 1980. Article 334 of the Constitution had originally required the reservation of seats to cease in 1960, but this was extended to 1970 by the 8th Amendment. The 23rd Amendment extended this period to 1980.  The period of reservation was extended to 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2030 by the 45th, 62nd, 79th, 95th and 104th Amendments respectively.

Government have, therefore, decided to terminate the privy purses and privileges of the Rulers of former Indian States. It is necessary for this purpose, apart from amending the relevant provisions of the Constitution, to insert a new article therein so as to terminate expressly the recognition already granted to such Rulers and to abolish privy purses and extinguish all rights, liabilities and obligations in respect of privy purses. Hence this Bill. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-second Year of the Republic of India as follows:--- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-sixty Amendment) Act, 1971. 2. Omission of articles 291 and 362.- Articles 291 and 362 of the Constitution shall be omitted. 3. Insertion of new article 363A.- After article 363 of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:--- \"363A.Recognition granted to Rulers of Indian States to cease and privy purses to be abolished.- Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution or in any law for the time being in force- (a) The Prince, Chief or other person who, at any time before the commencement of THE CONSTITUTION (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1971, was recognised by the President as the Ruler of an Indian State or any person who, at any time before such commencement, was recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler shall, on and from such commencement, cease to be recognised as such Ruler or the successor of such Ruler; (b) on and from the commencement of the Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1971, privy purse is abolished and all rights, liabilities and obligations in respect of privy purse are extinguished and accordingly the Ruler or, as the case may be, the successor of such Ruler, referred to in clause (a) or any other person shall not be paid any sum as privy purse.\". 4. Amendment of article 366.- In article 366 of the Constitution, for clause (22), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:- (22) \"Ruler\" means the Prince, Chief or other person who, at any time before the commencement of THE CONSTITUTION (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1971, was recognised by the President as the Ruler of an Indian State or any person who, at any time before such commencement, was recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler;\\'. [The Constitution (Twenty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 1971, its aim was to abolish the practice of privy purses and thereby make the political system more democratic. In return for surrendering their powers, Articles 291 and 362 guaranteed royal families a tax-free privy purse which was approximately one-fourth of what they had earlier earned. Thus, Article 291 and Article 362 which restricted equality and social justice of the democratic system were removed from the Constitution. Additionally, article 366 was amended and Article 33A inserted. Therefore, the decision was made to eliminate privy pursues and privileges that were enjoyed by former rulers of India. All the rights, liabilities, as well as obligations regarding the purses of the privy, were abolished. Important Verdict-Shri Raghunathrao Ganpatrao vs Union Of India ]'},\n",

The result of the judgment is that Parliament is considered to have no power to take away or curtail any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution even if it becomes necessary to do so for giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy and for the attainment of the objectives set out in the Preamble to the Constitution. It is, therefore, considered necessary to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution so as to include the provisions of Part III within the scope of the amending power. 2. The Bill seeks to amend article 368 suitably for the purpose and makes it clear that article 368 provides for amendment of the Constitution as well as procedure therefor. The Bill further provides that when a Constitution Amendment Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament is presented to the President for his assent, he should give his assent thereto. The Bill also seeks to amend article 13 of the Constitution to make it inapplicable to any amendment of the Constitution under article 368. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-second Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971. 2.

Amendment of article 368.- Article 368 of the Constitution shall be re-numbered as clause (2) thereof, and- (a) for the marginal heading to that article, the following marginal heading shall be substituted, namely:- \"Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution and procedure therefor.\"; (b) before clause (2) as so re-numbered, the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any provision of this Constitution in accordance with the procedure laid down in this article.\"; (c) in clause (2) as so re-numbered, for the words \"it shall be presented to the President for his assent and upon such assent being given to the Bill\", the words \"it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon\" shall be substituted; (d) after clause (2) as so re-numbered, the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(3) Nothing in article 13 shall apply to any amendment made under this article.\". [The Constitution (Twenty-Four Amendment) Act, 1971, enables Parliament to dilute Fundamental Rights through Amendments of the Constitution. It also amended Article 368 to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution. The amendment further made it obligatory for the President to give his assent, when a Constitution Amendment Bill was presented to him. The government has argued that the 24th Amendment will help to implement the Directive Principles of State Policy. However, a large section of constitutional experts would believe that the undisputed authority of Parliament is a threat to the democratic process in the country. In the Indian Constitution, the balance of legislative power is vital, and the power of amendment conferred to parliament to alter such regulations is often considered an important one. Important Verdict- Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala I.C. Golaknath and Ors. vs State of Punjab and Anrs. . However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the 24th Amendment Act is Constitutional. The ruling has several important implications. While it confirms that the 24th Amendment Act is valid, it establishes some significant constituent features like Judicial review and basic features of the Constitution. Also refer ]'},\n",

It is proposed to achieve this object by including the Union territory of Mizoram in article 239A of THE CONSTITUTION (clause 2). The Study Team appointed by the Administrative Reforms Commission on the Administration of Union Territories and NEFA has recommended that the Administrator of a Union territory with legislature may have the power to promulgate ordinances when the legislature is not in session. It is proposed to accept this recommendation and include a suitable provision in the Constitution conferring on such an Administrator the power to promulgate Ordinances (clause 3). Under paragraph 18(2) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution read with article 240 of the Constitution, the President is empowered to make Regulations for the North-East Frontier Agency. It is proposed to continue these powers even after the Agency becomes the Union territory of Arunachal Pradesh under the reorganisation scheme. It is also proposed to have similar powers with respect to the Union territory of Mizoram (clause 4). When the legislature of a State is dissolved or its functioning is suspended by a proclamation under article 356 of the Constitution, the Parliament is empowered to confer legislative powers on the President in respect of that State by passing a law under article 357(1). No such provision exists in the case of Union territories with legislatures, with the result that whenever the legislature of any Union territory is dissolved or its functioning is suspended by an order of the President, all legislation relating to that Union territory has to be passed by the Parliament. It is proposed that in such circumstances the Regulation making power under article 240 should be available to the President (clause 4). Hill Areas of Manipur are Predominantly inhabited by members of Scheduled Tribes. To safeguard their interests special provisions were made in section 562 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 for a Committee of the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Manipur consisting of members from the Hill Areas. When the Union territory of Manipur becomes a State under the reorganisation scheme, the said section 52 will cease to be operative. It is proposed, as a part of the scheme of safeguards for the people of the Hill Areas, to continue this arrangement even after Manipur becomes a State. So, a specific provision is being made in the Constitution for the formation of such a Committee (clause 5). This Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-second Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-seventh Amendment) Act, 1971. (2) This section and section 3 shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions of this Act shall come into force on such date_663, being a date not earlier than the day appointed under clause (b) of section 2 of the North- Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971, as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2. Amendment of article 239A.- In article 239A of the Constitution, in clause (1), for the words \"Goa, Daman and Diu, and Pondicherry\", the words \"Goa, Daman and Diu, Pondicherry and Mizoram\" shall be substituted. 3. Insertion of new article 239B.- After article 239A of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- 239B. Power of administrator to promulgate Ordinances during recess of Legislature.- (1) If at any time, except when the Legislature of a Union territory referred to in clause (1) of article 239A is in session, the administrator thereof is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to require: Provided that no such Ordinance shall be promulgated by the administrator except after obtaining instructions from the President in that behalf: Provided further that whenever the said Legislature is dissolved, or its functioning remains suspended on account of any action taken under any such law as is referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, the administrator shall not promulgate any Ordinance during the period of such dissolution or suspension. (2) An Ordinance promulgated under this article in pursuance of instructions from the President shall be deemed to be an Act of the Legislature of the Union territory which has been duly enacted after complying with the provisions in that behalf contained in any such law as is referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, but every such Ordinance- (a) shall be laid before the Legislature of the Union territory and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the Legislature or if, before the expiration of that period, a resolution disapproving it is passed by the Legislature, upon the passing of the resolution; and (b) may be withdrawn at any time by the administrator after obtaining instructions from the President in that behalf. (3) If and so far as an Ordinance under this article makes any provision which would not be valid if enacted in an Act of the Legislature of the Union territory made after complying with the provisions in that behalf contained in any such law as is referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, it shall be void. 4. Amendment of article 240.- In article 240 of the Constitution,- (a) in clause (1),- (i) after entry (e), the following entries shall be inserted, namely:- \"(f) Mizoram; (g) Arunachal Pradesh:\"; (ii) in the proviso, for the words \"Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu or Pondicherry\", the words \"Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, Pondicherry or Mizoram\" shall be substituted; (iii) after the proviso as so amended, the following further proviso shall be inserted, namely:- \"Provided further that whenever the body functioning as a Legislature for the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, Pondicherry or Mizoram is dissolved, or the functioning of that body as such Legislature remains suspended on account of any action taken under any such law as is referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, the President may, during the period of such dissolution or suspension, make regulations for the peace, progress and good government of that Union territory.\"; (b) in clause (2), the words \"any existing law\", the words \"any other law\" shall be substituted. 5. Insertion of new article 371C.- After article 371B of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- 371C. Special provision with respect to the State of Manipur.- (1) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the President may, by order made with respect to the State of Manipur, provide for the constitution and functions of a committee of the Legislative Assembly of the State consisting of members of that Assembly elected from the Hill Areas of that State, for the modifications to be made in the rules of business of the Government and in the rules of procedure of the Legislative Assembly of the State and for any special responsibility of the Governor in order to secure the proper functioning of such committee. (2) The Governor shall annually, or whenever so required by the President, make a report to the President regarding the administration of the Hill Areas in the State of Manipur and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of directions to the State as to the administration of the said areas. Explanation.-In this article, the expression \"Hill Areas\" means such areas as the President may, by order, declare to be Hill Areas.

In the Bank Nationalization case [1970, 3 S.C.R. 530), the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution guarantees right to compensation, that is, the equivalent in money of the property compulsorily acquired. Thus in effect the adequacy of compensation and the relevancy of the principles laid down by the Legislature for determining the amount of compensation have virtuality become justiciable inasmuch as the Court can go into the question whether the amount paid to the owner of the property is what may be regarded reasonably as compensation for loss of property. In the same case, the Court has also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for a public purpose should also satisfy the requirements of article 19 (1) (f). The Bill seeks to surmount the difficulties placed in the way of giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy by the aforesaid interpretation. The word \"compensation\" is sought to be omitted from article 31(2) and replaced by the word \"amount\". It is being clarified that the said amount may be given otherwise than in cash. It is also proposed to provide that article 19(1)(f) shall not apply to any law relating to the acquisition or requisitioning of property for a public purpose. 3. The Bill further seeks to introduce a new article 31C which provides that if any law is passed to give effect to the Directive Principles contained in clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and contains a declaration to that effect, such law shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it takes away or abridges any of the rights contained in article 14, 19 or 31 and shall not be questioned on the ground that it does not give effect to those principles. For this provision to apply in the case of laws made by State Legislatures, it is necessary that the relevant Bill should be reserved for the consideration of the President and receive his assent. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-second Year of the Republic of India as follow:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971. 2. Amendment of article 31.- In article 31 of the Constitution,- (a) for clause (2), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:- \"(2) No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for acquisition or requisitioning of the property for an amount which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law; and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash: Provided that in making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause (1) of article 30, the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause.\"; (b) after clause (2A), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(2B) Nothing in sub-clause (f) of clause (1) of article 19 shall affect any such law as is referred to in clause (2).\". 3. Insertion of new article 31C.- After article 31B of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- 31C. Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles.- Notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of article 39 shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14, article 19 or article 31; and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy: Provided that where such law is made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.\". [The Constitution (Twenty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 1971, curtailed the fundamental right to property, and permitted the acquisition of private property by the government for public use, on the payment of compensation which would be determined by the Parliament and not the courts.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-second Amendment) Bill, 1972 which was enacted as the Constitution (Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1972 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 (Act 1 of 1964), in the principal land reform law in the State of Kerala and was included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. In the course of implementation, the State Government faced serious practical difficulties and to overcome them, that Act was extensively amended by the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 (Act 35 of 1969) and by the Kerala and Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Act 25 of 1971). Certain crucial provisions of the principal Act as amended were challenged in the High Court of Kerala and in the Supreme Court, creating a climate of uncertainty in the effective implementation of land reforms. Although the High Court of Kerala has generally upheld the scheme of land reforms envisaged in the principal Act as amended, a few vital provisions have been struck down by the High Court. Even in regard to the provisions upheld by the High Court, the affected parties had moved the Supreme Court in appeal. Some persons also moved the Supreme Court in original petitions challenging certain provisions of the Act. The Supreme Court in its judgments delivered on 26th and 28th April, 1972, have generally uphold the scheme of land reforms as envisaged in the principal Act as amended but agreed with the High Court invalidating certain crucial provisions. It is feared that this will have far-reaching adverse affects on the implementation of the programme of land reforms in the State and thousands of tenants will be adversely affected by some of the provisions which have been either struck down or rendered ineffective. It is also apprehended that certain observations of the Supreme Court in the judgments might open the flood-gates of litigation much to the detriment of thousands of Kudikidappukars in the State who will not be able to defend themselves in protracted legal proceedings. Further, appeals have been preferred against the judgment of the Kerala High Court invalidating certain important provisions of the principal Act as amended [e.g. sections 4A (1)(a) and (b), 7, 7D(1) and 103] and they are pending in the Supreme Court. 2. It is, therefore, proposed to include the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 and the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution so that they may have the protection under article 31B and any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to the validity of those Acts is removed. The Bill seeks to achieve this object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-third Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1972. 2. Amendment of Ninth Schedule.- In the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, after entry 64 and before the Explanation the following entries shall be inserted, namely:- \"65. The Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 (Kerala Act 35 of 1969). 66. The Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Kerala Act 25 of 1971.\". [The Constitution (Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 1972, which aimed to expand the ninth schedule of the Indian Constitution, included laws from Kerala focused on land reform. Specifically, it added two acts to the schedule: the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 (Kerala Act 35 of 1969) and the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Kerala Act 25 of 1971). However, the legality of the 29th Amendment was challenged in a case brought by a petitioner whose land was subject to seizure under Kerala\\'s Land Reforms. The petitioner also questioned the validity of the 24th and 25th Constitutional Amendments, which they claimed impacted their fundamental rights. This case led to the development of the idea of the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, seven judges out of 13 ruled in favor of upholding the legitimacy of the 29th Amendment, although its validity was not upheld completely.

The concept of a class of officers with immutable conditions of service is incompatible with the changed social order. It is, therefore, considered necessary to amend the Constitution to provide for the deletion of article 314 and for the inclusion of a new article 312A which confers powers on Parliament to vary or revoke by law the conditions of service of the officers aforesaid and contains appropriate consequential and incidental provisions. 2. The Bill seeks to give effect the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-third Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Twenty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1972. (2) It shall come into force on such date_664 as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2. Insertion of new article 312A.- After article 312 of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- \"312A. Power of Parliament to vary or revoke conditions of service of officers of certain services (1) Parliament may by law- (a) vary or revoke, whether prospectively or retrospectively, the conditions of service as respects remuneration, leave and pension and the rights as respects disciplinary matters of persons who, having been appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a civil service of the Crown in India before the commencement of this Constitution, continue on and after the commencement of THE CONSTITUTION (Twenty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1972, to serve under the Government of India or of a State in any service or post; (b) vary or revoke, whether prospectively or retrospectively, the conditions of service as respects pension of persons who, having been appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a civil service of the Crown in India before the commencement of this Constitution, retired or otherwise ceased to be in service at any time before the commencement of the Constitution (Twenty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1972: Provided that in the case of any such person who is holding or has held the office of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court, the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, the Chairman or other member of the Union or a State Public Service Commission or the Chief Election Commissioner, nothing in sub-clause (a) or sub-clause (b) shall be construed as empowering Parliament to vary or revoke, after his appointment to such post, the conditions of his service to his disadvantage except in so far as such conditions of service are applicable to him by reason of his being a person appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a civil service of the Crown in India. (2) Except to the extent provided for by Parliament by law under this article, nothing in this article shall affect the power of any legislature or other authority under any other provision of this Constitution to regulate the conditions of service of persons referred to in clause (1). (3) Neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction in- (a) any dispute arising out of any provision of, or any endorsement on, any covenant, agreement or other similar instrument which was entered into or executed by any person referred to in clause (1), or arising out of any letter issued to such person, in relation to his appointment to any civil service of the Crown in India or his continuance in service under the Government of the Dominion of India or a Province thereof; (b) any dispute in respect of any right, liability or obligation under article 314 as originally enacted.

[The Constitution (Twenty-Eighth Amendment) Act, 1972, addressed the service conditions of All-India service officers, including pensions, leave, remuneration, and other rights that had previously made these officials immutable. As the social order in India changed in the two decades following independence, amendments were necessary to update the conditions of service for these officials. The amendment inserted a new Article 312A after Article 312 and repealed the original Article 314, changing the service conditions and providing for disciplinary matters related to people employed in the services.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 1972 which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirtieth Amendment) Act, 1973 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS This Bill seeks to give effect to the recommendations of the Law Commission of India in its Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Reports on Civil Appeals to the Supreme Court on certificate of fitness. At present an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, inter alia, on a certificate given by a High Court that the amount or the value of the subject-matter of dispute is not less than twenty thousand rupees or that the judgment, decree or final order involves, directly or indirectly, some claim or question respecting property of the like amount. The valuation cannot be the rational yardstick for a right to appeal. An important question of law can arise even in suits of small value and the test of valuation results in cases without merit going up to the Supreme Court. The Law Commission recommended that clauses (a) and (b) of article 133(1) of the Constitution should be omitted and that an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court only if the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance and that in the opinion of the High Court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. The amendment of the article accordingly would curtail the number of appeals which are filed in the Supreme Court merely on the valuation test being satisfied, without any merit in them. The Bill seeks to achieve this object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament the Twenty-third Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Thirtieth Amendment) Act, 1972. (2) It shall come into force on such date_665 as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2. Amendment of article 133.- In article 133 of the Constitution, for clause (1), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:- (1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court certifies- (a) that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance; and (b) that in the opinion of the High Court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.\". 3. Special provision as to pending proceedings, etc.- (1) Nothing in this Act shall affect- (a) any appeal under sub-clause (a) or sub-clause (b) or sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of article 133 of the Constitution which immediately before the commencement of this Act was pending before the Supreme Court; or (b) any appeal preferred on or after the commencement of this Act against any judgement, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court by virtue of a certificate given by the High Court before the commencement of this Act under sub-clause (a) or sub-clause (b) or sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of article 133. and every such appeal may be heard and disposed of or, as the case may be, entertained, heard and disposed of by the Supreme Court as if this Act had not been passed. (2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (1), no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court under clause (1) of article 133 of the Constitution from any judgment, decree or final order arising out of a suit or other civil proceeding which was instituted or commenced in any court before the commencement of this Act unless such appeal satisfies the provisions of that clause as amended by this Act. [The Constitution (Thirtieth Amendment) Act, 1972, changed the basis for appeals in civil cases before the Supreme Court of India from a value criterion to one based on important legal issues. It came into effect on June 9, 1972. This amendment modified Article 133 of the Constitution and enabled the Law Commission of India to implement the suggestions provided in its 44th and 45th reports on civil appeals to the Supreme Court regarding certificates of fitness. The purpose of this amendment is to require appeals of civil matters to the Supreme Court to raise a substantial question of law in order to be deemed fit for consideration. This change was based on the Law Commission\\'s recommendations and aims to streamline the process for hearing civil appeals in the Supreme Court.Also Refer](https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/30th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/)]'},\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-first Amendment) Bill, 1973 (Bill No. 31 of 1973) which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirty-first Amendment) Act, 1973 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Clause (1) of article 81 of the Constitution provides that the House of the People shall consist of not more than 500 members to be chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the States and not more than 25 members to represent the Union territories, chosen in such manner as Parliament may by law provide. As a result of the enactment of the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971 (81 of 1971), the total number of seats in the Lok Sabha allotted to the States has increased to 506, six more than the permissible limit of 500 under article 81. The actual total number of elected members of the present Lok Sabha is 522 (489 from the fifteen major States, 17 from the six smaller States of Himanchal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura each of which has a population of less than six millions and 16 from the nine Union territories). 2. Clause (2) of article 81 of the Constitution lays down that for the purposes of sub-clause (a) of clause (1), there shall be allotted to each State a number of seats in the House of the People in such manner that the ratio between that number and the population of the State is, so far as practicable, the same for all States and that each State shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is, so far as practicable, the same throughout the State. Under clause (3) of article 81, the expression \"population\" means the population as ascertained in the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published. Article 82 enjoins that on the completion of each census, the allocation of seats in the House of the People to the State and the division of each State into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted by such authority and in such manner as Parliament may by law determine. In pursuance of article 82, Parliament had enacted the Delimitation Act, 1972 and the Delimitation Commission has been constituted to undertake the necessary task of the readjustment envisaged in article 82.It will be noticed that adherence to the principles laid down in clause (2) of article 81 by the Delimitation Commission in undertaking readjustment as enjoined by article 82 on the basis of the 1971-census figures may have the effect of affecting the number of seats allotted to the States in the House of the People. It is felt that it would be better to ensure that any readjustment and consequent allocation of seats does not adversely affect the existing number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and to achieve this purpose it would be necessary to increase the strength of the Lok Sabha suitably. 3. In order to ensure that there is no reduction in the existing representation in the House of the People in respect of any of the States, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend article 81 so as to increase the upper limit for representation of the States from 500 to 525. The opportunity is taken to decrease the limit for the Union territories from 25 to 20, as the existing representation for Union territories is only 16. Government also consider it necessary to make an amendment in clause (2) of article 81 to provide that the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of article 81 shall not be applicable to any State so long as its population does not exceed six millions. This is to ensure that the existing representation in the Lok Sabha is maintained for the smaller States referred to in paragraph 1 above. 4. Article 330 of the Constitution relates to reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The provisons of this article have, however, been made inapplicable to the State of Nagaland on the ground that it has a predominantly tribal population. According to the 1971-census, 88.6 per cent. of Nagaland\\'s population belong to the Scheduled Tribes. The corresponding figures for the State of Meghalaya and the Union territories of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram are 80.5 per cent., 79.0 per cent. and 94.3 per cent. respectively. Government, therefore, consider that the provisions of article 330 should not apply also to the predominantly tribal units of Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Similarly, it is considered that as in the case of Nagaland, there need be no reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Meghalaya and the article 332 of the Constitution may be amended suitably. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to achieve these objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE It enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:--- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Thirty-first Amendment) Act, 1973. 2. Amendment of article 81.- In article 81 of the Constitution,- (a) in clause (1),- (i) in sub-clause (a), for the words \"five hundred members\", the words \"five hundred and twenty-five members\" shall be substituted; and (ii) in sub-clause (b), for the words \"twenty-five members\", the words \"twenty members\" shall be substituted; (b) in clause (2), after sub-clause (b), the following proviso shall be inserted, namely:- \"Provided that the provisions of sub-clause (a) of this clause shall not be applicable for the purpose of allotment of seats in the House of the People to any State so long as the population of that State does not exceed six millions.\". 3. Amendment of article 330.- (1) In article 330 of the Constitution,- (a) in sub-clause (b) of clause (1), for the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam and in Nagaland, and\", the following shall be substituted, namely:- \"except the Scheduled Tribes- (i) in the tribal areas of Assam; (ii) in Nagaland; (iii) in Meghalaya; (iv) in Arunachal Pradesh; and (v) in Mizoram; and\"; (b) after clause (2), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (2), the number of seats reserved in the House of the People for the Scheduled Tribes in the autonomous districts of Assam shall bear to the total number of seats allotted to that State a proportion not less than the population of the Scheduled Tribes in the said autonomous districts bears to the total population of the State.\". (2) The amendment made to article 330 of the Constitution by sub-section (1) shall not affect any representation in the House of the People until the dissolution of the House of the People existing at the commencement of this Act. 4. Amendment of article 332.- (1) In article 332 of the Constitution, in clause (1), for the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam and in Nagaland\" the words \"except the Scheduled Tribes in the tribal areas of Assam, in Nagaland and in Meghalaya\" shall be substituted. (2) The amendment made to article 332 of the Constitution by sub-section (1) shall not affect any representation in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Meghalaya until the dissolution of that Legislative Assembly existing at the commencement of this Act. [The Constitution (Thirty-First Amendment) Act, 1973, primary objective was the Parliament seats and thereby Articles 81, 330, and 332 were amended. The Amendment hailed as one of the more impactful Amendments as it led to the number of representatives from both houses being equal. That said, the number of representatives of either house, that is, the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha is not a fixed number. They may be increased or decreased if the situation requires. The government has the authority to take a call on the same and make the necessary adjustments. Such changes are usually brought about by the government when they believe that the inhabitants of a certain State are not represented fairly at either of the houses. They are also instigated by a change in demography. Also Refer ]'}],\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-third Amendment) Bill, 1973 which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirty-second Amendment) Act, 1973 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS When the State of Andhra Pradesh was formed in 1956, certain safeguards were envisaged for the Telangana area in the matter of development and also in the matter of employment opportunities and educational facilities for the residents of that area. The provisions of clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution were intended to give effect to certain features of these safeguards. The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, was enacted inter alia to provide for employment opportunities for residents of Telangana area. But in 1969, the Supreme Court held the relevant provision of the Act to be unconstitutional is so far as it related to the safeguards envisaged for the Telangana area. Owing to a variety of causes, the working of the safeguards gave rise to a certain amount of dissatisfaction sometimes in the Telangana area and sometimes in the other areas of the State. Measures were devised from time to time to resolve the problems. Recently several leaders of Andhra Pradesh made a concerted effort to analyse the factors which have been giving rise to the dissatisfaction and find enduring answers to the problems with a view to achieving fuller emotional integration of the people of Andhra Pradesh. On the 21st September, 1973, they suggested certain measures (generally known as the Six-Point Formula) indicating a uniform approach for promoting accelerated development of the backward areas of the State so as to secure the balanced development of the State as a whole and for providing equitable opportunities to different areas of the State in this matter of education, employment and career prospects in public services. This formula has received wide support in Andhra Pradesh and has been endorsed by the State Government. 2. This Bill has been brought forward to provide the necessary constitutional authority for giving effect to the Six-Point Formula in so far as it relates to the provision of equitable opportunities for people of different areas of the State in the matter of admission to educational institutions and public employment and constitution of an Administrative Tribunal with jurisdiction to deal with certain disputes and grievances relating to public services. The Bill also seeks to empower Parliament to legislate for establishing a Central University in the State and contains provisions of an incidental and consequential nature including the provision for the validation of certain appointments made in the past. As the Six-Point Formula provides for the discontinuance of the Regional Committee constituted under clause (1) of article 371 of the Constitution, the Bill also provides for the repeal of that clause. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1.

Insertion of new articles 371D and 371E.- After article 371C of the Constitution, the following articles shall be inserted, namely:- \"371D. Special provisions with respect to the State of Andhra Pradesh.- (1) The President may by order made with respect to the State of Andhra Pradesh provide, having regard to the requirements of the State as a whole, for equitable opportunities and facilities for the people belonging to different parts of the State, in the matter of public employment and in the matter of education, and different provisions may be made for various parts of the State. (2) An order made under clause (1) may, in particular,- (a) require the State Government to organise any class or classes of posts in civil service of, or any class or classes of civil posts under, the State into different local cadres for different parts of the State and allot in accordance with such principles and procedure as may be specified in the order the persons holding such posts to the local cadres so organised; (b) specify any part or parts of the State which shall be regarded as the local area- (i) for direct recruitment to posts in any local cadre (whether organised in pursuance of an order under this article or constituted otherwise) under the State Government; (ii) for direct recruitment to posts in any cadre under any local authority within the State; and (iii) for the purposes of admission to any University within the State or to any other educational institution which is subject to the control of the State Government; (c) specify the extent to which, the manner in which and the conditions subject to which, preference or reservation shall be given or made- (i) in the matter of direct recruitment to posts in any such cadre referred to in sub-clause (b) as may be specified in this behalf in the order; (ii) in the matter of admission to any such University or other educational institution referred to in sub-clause (b) as may be specified in this behalf in the order, to or in favour of candidates who have resided or studied for any period specified in the order in the local area in respect of such cadre, University or other educational institution, as the case may be. (3) The President may, by order, provide for the constitution of an Administrative Tribunal for the State of Andhra Pradesh to exercise such jurisdiction, powers and authority [including any jurisdiction, power and authority which immediately before the commencement of the Constitution (Thirty-second Amendment) Act, 1973, was exercisable by any court (other than the Supreme Court) or by any tribunal or other authority] as may be specified in the order with respect to the following matters, namely:--- (a) appointment, allotment or promotion to such class or classes of posts in any civil service of the State, or to such class or classes of civil posts under the State, or to such class or classes of posts under the control of any local authority within the State, as may be specified in the order; (b) seniority of persons appointed, allotted or promoted to such class or classes of posts in any civil service of the State, or to such class or classes of civil posts under the State, or to such class or classes of posts under the control of any local authority within the State, as may be specified in the order; (c) such other conditions of service of persons appointed, allotted or promoted to such class or classes of posts in any civil service of the State or to such class or classes of civil posts under the State or to such class or classes of posts under the control of any local authority within the State, as may be specified in the order.

(5) The order of the Administrative Tribunal finally disposing of any case shall become effective upon its confirmation by the State Government or on the expiry of three months from the date on which the order is made, whichever is earlier: Provided that the State Government may, by special order made in writing and for reasons to be specified therein, modify or annul any order or the Administrative Tribunal before it becomes effective and in such a case, the order of the Administrative Tribunal shall have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be. (6) Every special order made by the State Government under the proviso to clause (5) shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before both Houses of the State Legislature.

Amendment of Seventh Schedule.- In the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, in List I, in entry 63, for the words \"Delhi University, and\", the words, figures and letter \"Delhi University; the University established in pursuance of article 371E;\" shall be substituted. [The Constitution (Thirty-Second Amendment) Act, 1973, had the primary goal of protecting regional rights in the Telangana and Andhra regions of Andhra Pradesh state. It included special rules for enrollment in educational institutions and the establishment of an administrative tribunal to handle disagreements and complaints involving public services, particularly in civil services. The Amendment Act modified Article 371 of the Constitution and added Articles 371D and 371E as part of the 1987 amendments, which are specific to the state of Andhra Pradesh. The intention behind the enactment of Article 371E was to enable the building of a Central University in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Additionally, the Constitution\\'s Seventh Schedule was also amended. Also Refer ]'},\n",

The suggestions of the Chief Ministers\\' Conference were accepted by the Government of India and necessary guidelines were issued to the State Governments for the revision of ceiling laws. 2. It is proposed to amend the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution to include therein the revised ceiling laws which have so far been enacted in broad conformity with the aforesaid guidelines so that they may have the protection under article 31B of the Constitution and any uncertainty or doubt that may arise in regard to the validity of those laws is removed. In addition, two Acts dealing with the abolition of intermediary tenures are also proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule, namely, the Bihar Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1972 and the Gudalur Janmam Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1969, so that they may also have the same protection. 3.

[The Constitution (Thirty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1974, remains an important milestone in the evolution of Indian democracy. The amendment brought about significant changes to the constitutional framework of the country, particularly with respect to the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and the rights of the citizens. These proposals were about the removal of exemptions, the reduction of the maximum on land holdings, and the application of a ceiling based on the amount of land owned by a family. The Amendment added 20 more state laws (New entries 67 to 86) dealing with land reforms and ceilings to the Ninth Schedule in order to make it clear that these laws cannot be challenged on the grounds that they conflict with any sections of Part III of the Constitution’s Fundamental Rights clause.

In the recent past, there have been instances where coercive measures have been resorted to for compelling members of a Legislative Assembly to resign their membership. If this is not checked, it might become difficult for Legislatures to function in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It is, therefore proposed to amend the above two articles to impose a requirement as to acceptance of the resignation by the Speaker or the Chairman and to provide that the resignation shall not be accepted by the Speaker or the Chairman if he is satisfied after making such inquiry as he thinks fit that the resignation is not voluntary or genuine. 2. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-fifty Year of the Republic of India as follows:--- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Thirty-third Amendment) Act, 1974. 2.

Amendment of article 190.- In article 190 of the Constitution, in clause (3),- (1) for sub-clause (b), the following sub-clause shall be substituted, namely:- \"(b) resigns his seat by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, and his resignation is accepted by the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be,\"; (2) the following proviso shall be inserted at the end, namely:- \"Provided that in the case of any resignation referred to in sub-clause (b), if from information received or otherwise and after making such inquiry as he thinks fit, the speaker or the chairman, as the case may be, is satisfied that such resignation is not voluntary or genuine, he shall not accept such resignation.\". [The Constitution (Thirty-Third Amendment) Act, 1974, specifies the methodology by which members of the House of Parliament or State Legislators can withdraw their membership and the grounds on which the Speaker/Chairman can accept or refuse their resignation.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Fortieth Amendment) Bill, 1975 which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Article 71 of the Constitution provides that disputes arising out of the election of the President or Vice-President shall be decided by the Supreme Court. The same article provides that matters relating to their election shall be regulated by a parliamentary law. So far as the Prime Minister and the Speaker are concerned, matters relating to their election are regulated by the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Under this Act the High Court has jurisdiction to try an election petition presented against either of them. 2. The President, the Vice-President, the Prime Minister and the Speaker are holders of high offices. The President is not answerable to a court of law for anything done, while in office, in the exercise of his powers. A fortiori matters relating to his election should not be brought before a court of law but should be entrusted to a forum other than a court. The same reasoning applies equally to the incumbents of the offices of Vice-President, Prime Minister and Speaker. It is accordingly proposed to provide that disputes relating to the election of the President and Vice-President shall be determined by a forum as may be determined by a parliamentary law. Similar provision is proposed to be made in the case of the election to either House of Parliament or, as the case may be, to the House of the People of a person holding the office of Prime Minister or the Speaker. It is further proposed to render pending proceedings in respect of such election under the existing law null and void. The Bill also provides that the parliamentary law creating a new forum for trial of election matters relating to the incumbents of the high offices abovementioned shall not be called in question in any court. 3. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interests of the public was imperilled by litigation. It has become necessary to have recourse to this device once again now. Between 1971 and 1973 legislation was enacted for nationalising coking coal and coal mines for conservating these resources in the interests of steel industry. These enactments have been brought before courts on the ground that they are unconstitutional. So is the case of sick textile undertakings which were nationalised in 1974. To prevent smuggling of goods and diversion of foreign exchange which affected national economy Parliament enacted legislation which again has been challenged in the Supreme Court and in High Courts. These and other important and special enactments which it is considered necessary should have the constitutional protection under article 31B, are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain State legislations relating to land reform and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain amendments made to these legislations also require protection of the provisions of article 31B. 4. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975. 2. Substitution of new article for article 71.- For article 71 of the Constitution, the following article shall be substituted, namely:- \"71. Matters relating to or connected with the election of a President or Vice-President.-(1) Subject of the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may by law regulate any matter relating to or connected with the election of a President or Vice-President, including the grounds on which such election may be questioned: Provided that the election of a person as President or Vice-President shall not be called in question on the ground of the existence of any vacancy for whatever reason among the members of the electoral college electing him. (2) All doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with the election of a President or Vice-President shall be inquired into and decided by such authority or body and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law referred to in clause (1). (3) The validity of any such law as is referred to in clause (1) and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court. (4) If the election of a person as President or Vice-President is declared void under any such law as is referred to in clause (1), acts done by him in the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of the office of President or Vice-President, as the case may be, on or before the date of such declaration shall not be invalidated by reason of that declaration.\". 3. Amendment of article 329.- In article 329 of the Constitution, for the words \"Notwithstanding any thing in this Constitution\", the words, figures and letter \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution but subject to the provisions of article 329A\" shall be substituted. 4. Insertion of new article 329A.- In Part XV of the Constitution, after article 329, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- \"329A. Special provision as to elections to Parliament in the case of Prime Minister and Speaker.-(1) Subject to the provisions of Chapter II of Part V [except sub-clause (e) of clause (1) of article 102], no election- (a) to either House of Parliament of a person who holds the office of Prime Minister at the time of such election or is appointed as Prime Minister after such election; (b) to the House of the People of a person who holds the office of Speaker of that House at the time of such election or who is chosen as the Speaker for that House after such election, shall be called in question, except before such authority [not being any such authority as is referred to in clause (b) of article 329] or body and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by Parliament and any such law may provide for all other matters relating to doubts and disputes in relation to such election including the grounds on which such election may be questioned. (2) The validity of any such law as is referred to in clause (1) and the decision of any authority or body under such law shall not be called in question in any court.

(4) No law made by Parliament before the commencement of the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith, shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election to any such person as is referred to in clause (1) to either House of Parliament and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void or has, before such commencement, been declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by any court, before such commencement, declaring such election to be void, such election shall continue to be valid in all respects and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of no effect. (5) Any appeal or cross appeal against any such order of any court as is referred to in clause (4) pending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, before the Supreme Court shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of clause (4).

The Resolution declared that the Assembly had satisfied itself that these activities of the Chogyal not only violated the objectives of the Agreement of May 8, 1973, but also ran counter to the wishes of the people of Sikkim and impeded their democratic development and participation in the political and economic life of India. Accordingly the Assembly solemnly declared and resolved that \"The institution of the Chogyal is hereby abolished and Sikkim shall henceforth be a constituent unit of India, enjoying a democratic and fully responsible Government\". 2. The Assembly also resolved that this Resolution be submitted to the people of Sikkim forthwith for their approval. A special opinion poll conducted by the Government of Sikkim on the 14th April, 1975 resulted in a total of 59,637 votes in favour and 1,496 votes against the Resolution out of a total electorate of approximately 97,000. 3. The result of this poll was communicated to the Government of India by the Chief Minister of Sikkim on the 15th April, 1975. The Chief Minister on behalf of the Council of Ministers strongly requested the Government of India to make an immediate response and accept the above decision, taking, as has been requested in the Assembly Resolution of the 10th April, 1975, such measures as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the decision as early as possible. 4. The Chief Minister and other Ministers of Sikkim also visited New Delhi on the 16th-17th April, 1975 and urged the Government of India to take immediate action in this behalf. 5. Accordingly, it is proposed to include Sikkim as a full-fledged State in the First Schedule to the Constitution and to allot to Sikkim one seat in the Council of States and one seat in the House of the People.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Bill, 1975 which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1975 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Constitution (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Bill, 1975 seeks to amend articles 123, 213, 239B, 352, 356, 359 and 360 of the Constitution. 2. Article 123 empowers the President to promulgate Ordinances when both the Houses of Parliament are not in session if he is satisfied that circumstance exist rendering it necessary to take immediate action. Corresponding powers have been conferred by the Constitution on the Governor under article 213. Similar powers have been conferred on the Administrator under article 239B when the Legislature of a Union territory is not in session. On the plain language of articles 123, 213 and 239B there is no doubt that the satisfaction mentioned in those articles is subjective satisfaction and that it is not justiciable. There is no doubt that this was also the intention of the makers of the Constitution. However, litigation is pending involving the justifiability of this issue and contentions are being raised that the issue is subject to judicial scrutiny. To place the matter beyond doubt, it is proposed to provide in the Constitution that the satisfaction of the President, Governor or Administrator shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground. 3. Article 352 empowers the President to declare Emergency if he is satisfied that the security of India or any part of it is threatened by war, external aggression or internal disturbance. Article 356 empowers the President to assume to himself the functions of the Government of a State if the constitutional machinery in any State fails and the Government in the State cannot be carried on. Likewise article 360 empowers the President to declare Financial Emergency if he is satisfied that the financial stability of India is threatened. Here again, the issue regarding satisfaction is, on the face of the articles clearly not justiciable. However, as the validity of the Proclamation issued under article 352 has been challenged in several proceedings and as litigation of this nature involves waste of public time and money, it is proposed to amend these three articles so as to make the satisfaction of the President final and conclusive and not justiciable on any ground. 4. In addition to article 352, contentions have been raised in certain writ petitions that while the original Proclamation of Emergency is in operation no further Proclamation of Emergency could be made thereunder. In order to place the matter beyond doubt it is proposed to make it clear in article 352 that the President may issue different Proclamations on different grounds whether or not there is a Proclamation already in existence and in operation. 5. When a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President is empowered under article 359 of the Constitution to make an order suspending the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in that order. It was intended that the powers conferred by this article should be exercised during an emergency according to needs of the situation. On the other hand, article 358 renders the provisions of article 19 automatically inoperative while the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, and the power to make any law or to take any executive action is not restricted by the provisions of that article. The intention underlying article 359 appears to be that when an order is made under clause (1) of that article in relation to any of the rights conferred by Part III and mentioned in the order, the order so made would have for all practical purposes the same effect in relation to those rights as article 358 has in relation to article 19. It is, therefore, proposed not to have any differences in language between article 358 and the language in respect of those rights only which may be mentioned in the Presidential Order under clause (1) of article 359. 6. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1975. 2. Amendment of article 123.- In article 123 of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clause shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the President mentioned in clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.\". 3. Amendment of article 213.- In article 213 of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clause shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the Governor mentioned in clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.\". 4. Amendment of article 239B.- In article 239B of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clause shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the administrator mentioned in clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.\". 5. Amendment of article 352.- In article 352 of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clauses shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(4) The power conferred on the President by this article shall include the power to issue different Proclamations on different grounds, being war or external aggression or internal disturbance or imminent danger of war or external aggression or internal disturbance, whether or not there is a Proclamation already issued by the President under clause (1) and such Proclamation is in operation. (5) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution,- (a) the satisfaction of the President mentioned in clause (1) and clause (3) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground; (b) subject to the provisions of clause (2), neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any question, on any ground, regarding the validity of- (i) a declaration made by Proclamation by the President to the effect stated in clause (1); or (ii) the continued operation of such Proclamation.\". 6. Amendment of article 356.- In article 356 of the Constitution, after clause (4), the following clause shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(5) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the President mentioned in clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.\". 7. Amendment of article 359.- In article 359 of the Constitution, after clause (1), the following clause shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(1A) While an order made under clause (1) mentioning any of the right conferred by Part III is in operation, nothing in that Part conferring those rights shall restrict the power of the State as defined in the said Part to make any law or to take any executive action which the State would but for the provisions contained in that Part be competent to make or to take, but any law so made shall, to the extent of the incompetency, cease to have effect as soon as the order aforesaid ceases to operate, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect.\". 8. Amendment of article 360.- In article 360 of the Constitution, after clause (4), the following clause shall be inserted, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted, namely:- \"(5) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution,- (a) the satisfaction of the President mentioned in clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground; (b) subject to the provisions of clause (2), neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any question, on any ground, regarding the validity of- (i) a declaration made by Proclamation by the President to the effect stated in clause (1); or (ii) the continued operation of such Proclamation.\". [The Constitution (Thirty-Eighth Amendment) Act, 1975, codified the declaration of Emergency and empowered the State to remove fundamental rights during a state of emergency. This made the Emergency final and inclusive, giving the State the power to suspend certain rights of its citizens. Currently, there is an ongoing amendment procedure aimed at eliminating obsolete and unproductive portions of the Constitution and integrating new ones to address evolving social requirements. Any changes made should aim to improve people’s living conditions and foster social peace, rather than demolishing the current framework.\" Also Refer ]'},\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Thirty-seventh Amendment) Bill, 1975 which was enacted as the Constitution (Thirty-seventh Amendment) Act, 1975 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Union territory of Arunachal Pradesh is at present administered through a Chief Commissioner. It has a Pradesh Council, consisting mostly of representatives of Zila Parishads, which functions as an advisory body on important matters relating to the administration of the Union territory. Some members of the Pradesh Council are also associated with the Chief Commissioner in the day-to-day administration as Counsellors. It is proposed to replace the Pradesh Council by a Legislative Assembly and the Counsellors by a Council of Ministers, as in certain other Union territories specified in article 239A of the Constitution. The Bill, therefore, seeks to include Arunachal Pradesh in that article. 2. Under article 240 of the Constitution, the President is empowered to make regulations for the Union territory of Arunchal Pradesh. With the Constitution of a Legislative Assembly for the Union territory, it is proposed to provide that, as in the case of other Union territories with Legislatures, this power may be exercised only when the Assembly is either dissolved or its functioning remains suspended. The Bill seeks to amend article 240 also to achieve this object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Thirty-seventh Amendment) Act, 1975. 2.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1976 (Bill No. 91 of 1976) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS A Constitution to be living must be growing. If the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the Constitution will suffer a virtual atrophy. The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio-economic revolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of Government and the public for some years now. 2. The democratic institutions provided in the Constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. However, there could be no denial that these institutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good. 3. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles. It is also proposed to specify the fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities, whether by individuals or associations. 4. Parliament and the State Legislatures embody the will of the people and the essence of democracy is that the will of the people should prevail. Even though article 368 of the Constitution is clear and categoric with regard to the all inclusive nature of the amending power, it is considered necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. It is proposed to strengthen the presumption in favour of the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures by providing for a requirements as to the minimum number of Judges for determining questions as to the constitutionality of laws and for a special majority of not less than two-thirds for declaring any law to be constitutionally invalid. It is also proposed to take away the jurisdiction of High Courts with regard to determination of Constitutional validity of Central laws and confer exclusive jurisdiction in this behalf on the Supreme Court so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings with regard to validity of the same Central law in different High Courts and the consequent possibility of the Central law being valid in one State and invalid in another State. 5. To reduce the mounting arrears in High Courts and to secure the speedy disposal of service matters, revenue matters and certain other matters of special importance in the context of the socio-economic development and progress, it is considered expedient to provide for administrative and other tribunals for dealing with such matters while preserving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in regard to such matters under article 136 of the Constitution. It is also necessary to make certain modifications in the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under article 226. 6. It is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to make certain other amendments which have become necessary in the light of the working of the Constitution. 7. The various amendments proposed in the Bill have been explained in the notes on clauses. 8. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. ------ ARRANGEMENT OF SECTIONS ------ SECTIONS 1.

[The Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976, made significant changes to the Constitution of India. It established parliament as the supreme sovereign body and excluded courts from handling election disputes. It also strengthened the power of the central government, transforming India from a federal to a \"composite\" federal system, and limited the judiciary\\'s ability to challenge legislation. Despite its many changes, the Indian Constitution remains the supreme law of the land and is considered a \"living breathing\" document. Its flexibility allows the Supreme Court of India to interpret it creatively in accordance with the true spirit of democracy. This true spirit lies in making changes that are essential for the survival of the nation. Since independence, there have been many amendments made to the Constitution, with varying degrees of success. Some amendments aimed to increase the powers of the states and decentralize economic development. The Forty-Second Amendment sought to check the rise of regional parties, known as \"regionalism,\" by granting states greater autonomy in development.Important Verdict- Minerva Mills Ltd.

India has sovereign rights over the resources of the exclusive economic zone and is entitled to exercise jurisdiction in respect of certain other matters. It is proposed to amend article 297 of the Constitution so as to provide that all lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the exclusive economic zone of India and all other resources of the exclusive economic zone of India shall also vest in the Union and be held for the purposes of the Union. At present, the limits of territorial waters and the continental shelf are determined by Proclamation issued by the President. It is proposed that the limits of the territorial waters, the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone and the maritime zones of India shall be as specified from time to time by or under law made by Parliament. 2. Recourse was had in the past to the Ninth Schedule whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation. Certain State legislations relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Certain amendments made to these legislations also require protection of the provisions of article 31B inasmuch as in many cases such enactments have been challenged in courts and courts have granted interim reliefs which has hampered the implementation of the national land reform policy. 3. Besides these Acts relating to land reforms certain State enactments relating to private forests require protection of article 31B as these enactments are progressive and beneficial pieces of legislation intended to and the monopoly of vested interests and forest contractors. Some of such legislations have been challenged in courts and as the courts have granted interim reliefs staying the operation of these enactments, the State Governments have not been able to implement these legislations. 4. Certain Central laws like the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and certain provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 require protection of article 31B. If these legislations are allowed to be challenged in courts of law thereby delaying the implementation of these laws, the vary purpose of enacting these laws would be frustrated and the national economy may be severely affected. These and other important and special enactments which it is considered necessary should have the constitutional protection are proposed to be included in the Ninth Schedule. 5. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Fortieth Amendment) Act, 1976. 2. Substitution of new article for article 297.- For article 297 of the Constitution, the following article shall be substituted, namely:- \"297. Things of value within territorial waters or continental shelf and resources of the exclusive economic zone to vest in the Union.- (1) All lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters, or the continental shelf, or the exclusive economic zone, of India shall vest in the Union and be held for the purposes of the Union. (2) All other resources of the exclusive economic zone of India shall also vest in the Union and be held for the purposes of the Union.

This was the position when the Constitution came into force. Subsequently, while the age of retirement of the High Court Judges was raised to 62, that of the Chairman and the Members of the State Public Service Commissions remained unchanged. The same article provides that one-half of the members of every Public Service Commission shall be employees of the Government of India or the Government of a State. The age of retirement of Government employees was 55 originally but was later raised to 58 in the case of All-India Services, Central Government servants and the Government servants of several States. Membership of the Commission is no attraction, therefore, to them, as they will have only two years to serve on the Commission which position is not desirable from the point of view of the efficient functioning of the Commission. Academicians like University Professors are eligible for appointment to the State Public Service Commissions. The age of retirement of University Professors has been recently raised to 60. It will not be attractive for these academicians to serve on a Public Service Commission if the age of retirement remains sixty. The Chairman/Members of a State Public Service Commission are forbidden to serve under the Government of India or a State Government after retirement. Consequently, no eminent academician will be eager to accept appointment on the Commission unless the age of retirement is raised to 62. The proposal is to raise the age of retirement of the Chairman and Members of the State Public Service Commissions to 62. The Bill seeks to give effect to this proposal. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Forty-first Amendment) Act, 1976. 2. Amendment of article 316.- In article 316 of the Constitution, in clause (2), for the words \"sixty years\", the words \"sixty-two years\" shall be substituted. [The Constitution (Forty-First Amendment) Act, 1976, changed the retirement age of the Chairman and members of the State Public Service Commissions from 60 to 62 years, by amending Article 316(2) of the Constitution. However, it was later amended to 58 for employees of the All-India Services, the Central Government, and many State governments. Consequently, they are not interested in joining the Commission because they will only have two years to serve, which is seen as undesirable for the efficient functioning of the Commission.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1977 (Bill No. 148 of 1977) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-third Amendment) Act, 1977 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, inserted various articles in the Constitution to curtail, both directly and indirectly, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts to review the constitutionality of laws. Article 32A barred the Supreme Court from considering the constitutional validity of any State law in proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights unless the constitutional validity of any Central law was also in issue in such proceedings. Article 131A gave to the Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to decide the constitutional validity of a Central law and thus deprived the High Courts of their jurisdiction in respect of the same. Article 144A provided that the minimum number of Judges of the Supreme Court who shall sit for the purpose of determining the constitutional validity of any Central law or State law shall be seven and required a special majority of two-thirds for the invalidation of such law. Article 226A barred the High Courts from deciding the validity of any Central law and article 228A required that there should be a Bench of at least five Judges for determining the constitutional validity of any State law and prescribed a special majority for a judgment invalidating such a law. 2. It is considered that articles 32A, 131A and 228A cause, hardship to persons living in distant parts in India. Further, article 32A would lead to multiplicity of proceedings as cases relating to the validity of a State law which could be disposed of by the Supreme Court itself have to be heard first by the High Court. The minimum number of Judges in every case wherein the constitutional validity of a law is involved, however unsubstantial the challenge might be, results in valuable judicial time being lost in hearing and rejecting submissions that have no substance. The Supreme Court has, in M/s. Misrilal Jain vs. the State of Orissa and Others (AIR 1977 SC 1686) expressed the hope that article 144A would engage the prompt attention of Parliament and would be amended so as to leave to the court itself the duty to decide how large a Bench should decide any particular case. In fact, a number of cases have been held up in the Supreme Court and High Courts as a result of the aforementioned articles. 3. It is, therefore, proposed to omit articles 32A, 131A, 144A, 226A and 228A. It is also proposed to make special provisions to enable the Supreme Court and the High Courts to deal with pending cases in the same manner as if the said articles had been omitted with effect from the 1st February, 1977 (viz., the date on which those articles were brought into force). Necessary consequential amendments to articles 145, 228 and 366 are also proposed to be made. 4. Article 31D confers special power on Parliament to enact certain laws in respect of anti-national activities. It is considered that these powers of Parliament to make laws for dealing with anti-national activities and anti-national associations are of a sweeping nature and are capable of abuse. It is, therefore, proposed to omit article 31D. 5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-eighth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Forty-third Amendment) Act, 1977. 2. Omission of article 31D.- Article 31D of the Constitution shall be omitted. 3. Omission of article 32A.- (1) Article 32A of the Constitution shall be omitted. (2) Any proceedings pending before the Supreme Court under article 32 of the Constitution immediately before the commencement of this Act may be dealt with by the Supreme Court as if the said article 32A had been omitted with effect on and from the 1st day of February, 1977. 4. Omission of article 131A.- (1) Article 131A of the Constitution shall be omitted. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where immediately before the commencement of this Act any reference made by a High Court under the said article 131A is pending before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court may, having regard to- (a) the stage at which the reference is so pending; and (b) the ends of justice, either deal with the case as if that article had not been omitted or return the case of the High Court for disposal as if that article had been omitted with effect on and from the 1st day of February, 1977. 5. Omission of article 144A.- (1) Article 144A of the Constitution shall be omitted. (2) Any case pending before the Supreme Court immediately before the commencement of this Act may be dealt with by the Supreme Court as if the said article 144A had been omitted with effect on and from the 1st day of February, 1977. 6. Amendment of article 145.- In article 145 of the Constitution,- (a) in clause (1), in sub-clause (cc), for the words, figures and letters \"articles 131A and 139A\", the word, figures and letter \"article 139A\" shall be substituted; (b) in clause (2), the words, figures and letter \"article 144A and of\" shall be omitted; (c) in clause (3), the words, figures and letter \"Subject to the provisions of article 144A,\" shall be omitted. 7. Amendment of article 226.- In article 226 of the Constitution, in clause (1), the words, figures and letters \"but subject to the provisions of article 131A and article 226A\" shall be omitted. 8. Omission of article 226A.- (1) Article 226A of the Constitution shall be omitted. (2) Any proceedings pending before a High Court under article 226 of the Constitution immediately before the commencement of this Act may be dealt with by the High Court as if the said article 226A had been omitted with effect on and from the 1st day of February, 1977. 9. Amendment of article 228.- In article 228 of the Constitution, in the opening portion, the words, figures and letter\", subject to the provisions of article 131A,\" shall be omitted. 10. Omission of article 228A.- (1) Article 228A of the Constitution shall be omitted. (2) Any case pending before a High Court immediately before the commencement of this Act may be dealt with by the High Court as if the said article 228A had been omitted with effect on and from the 1st day of February, 1977. 11. Amendment of article 366.- In article 366 of the Constitution, clause (4A) and clause (26A) shall be omitted. [The Constitution (Forty-Third Amendment) Act, 1977, repealed six articles (31D, 32A, 131A, 144A, 226A, and 228A) that had been inserted into the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment. These articles had given Parliament the authority to restrict legal union activity under the guise of preventing anti-national activity, thereby infringing on civil liberties. The repeal of Article 31D restores these civil liberties, and amends Articles 145, 228, and 366 to facilitate the omission of the six repealed articles.The elimination of Article 31D also restores legislative powers to the states, allowing them to address anti-national activity in a manner that upholds fundamental rights. Additionally, the judiciary has been restored to its proper place by the legislation. The Supreme Court will now have jurisdiction to declare state laws unlawful. This repeal marks an important step in the protection of civil liberties and the preservation of the constitutional balance between state and federal authority. Also Refer ]'}],\n",

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fifth Amendment) Bill, 1978 (Bill No. 88 of 1978) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Recents experience has shown that the fundamental rights, including those of life and liberty, granted to citizens by the Constitution are capable of being taken away by a transient majority. It is, therefore, necessary to provide adequate safeguards against the recurrence of such a contingency in the future and to ensure to the people themselves an effective voice in determining the form of government under which they are to live. This is one of the primary objects of this Bill. 2. It is, therefore, proposed to provide that certain changes in the Constitution which would have the effect of impairing its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage and compromising the independence of judiciary, can be made only if they are approved by the people of India by a majority of votes at a referendum in which at least fifty-one per cent. of the electorate participate. Article 368 is being amended to ensure this. 3. In view of the special position sought to be given to fundamental rights, the right to property, which has been the occasion for more than one amendment of the Constitution, would cease to be a fundamental right and become only a legal right. Necessary amendments for this purpose are being made to article 19 and article 31 is being deleted. It would, however, be ensured that the removal of property from the list of fundamental rights would not affect the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. 4. Similarly, the right of persons holding land for personal cultivation and within the ceiling limit to receive compensation at the market value would not be affected. 5. Property, while ceasing to be a fundamental right, would, however, be given express recognition as a legal right, provision being made that no person shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with law. 6. A Proclamation of Emergency under article 352 has virtually the effect of amending the Constitution by converting it for the duration into that of a Unitary State and enabling the rights of the citizen to move the courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights---including the right to life and liberty---to be suspended. Adequate safeguards are, therefore, necessary to ensure that this power is properly exercised and is not abused. It is, therefore, proposed that a Proclamation of Emergency can be issued only when the security of India or any part of its territory is threatened by war or external aggression or by armed rebellion. Internal disturbance not amounting to armed rebellion would not be a ground for the issue of a Proclamation. 7. Further, in order to ensure that a Proclamation is issued only after due consideration, it is sought to be provided that an Emergency can be proclaimed only on the basis of written advice tendered to the President by the Cabinet. In addition, as a Proclamation of Emergency virtually has the effect of amending the Constitution, it is being provided that the Proclamation would have to be approved by the two Houses of Parliament by the same majority which is necessary to amend the Constitution and such approval would have to be given within a period of one month. Any such Proclamation would be in force only for a period of six months and can be continued only by further resolutions passed by the same majority. The Proclamation would also cease to be in operation if a resolution disapproving the continuance of the Proclamation is passed by Lok Sabha. Ten per cent. or more of the Members of Lok Sabha can requisition a special meeting for considering a resolution for disapproving the Proclamation. 8. As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing, it would be provided that the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be exercised in respect of the fundamental right to life and liberty. The right to liberty is further strengthened by the provision that a law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than two months, unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention. An additional safeguard would be provided by the requirement that the Chairman of an Advisory Board shall be a serving Judge of the appropriate High Court and that the Board shall be constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of that High Court. 9. A special provision is being made guaranteeing the right of the media to report freely and without censorship the proceedings in Parliament and the State Legislatures. The provision with regard to the breakdown of the constitutional machinery in the States is being amended so as to provide that a Proclamation issued under article 356 would be in force only for a period of six months in the first instance and that it cannot exceed one year ordinarily. However, if a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation and the Election Commission certifies that the extension of the President\\'s rule beyond a period of one year is necessary on account of difficulties in holding elections to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, the period of operation of the Proclamation can be extended beyond one year. This is subject to the existing limit of three years. These changes would ensure that democratic rule is restored to a State after the minimum period which will be necessary for holding elections. 10. With a view to avoiding delays, it is proposed to amend articles 132, 133 and 134 and insert a new article 134A to provide that a High Court should consider the question of granting a certificate for appeal to Supreme Court immediately after the delivery of the judgment, decree, final order or sentence concerned on the basis of an oral application by a party or, if the High Court deems fit so to do, on its own motion. Cases of special leave to appeal by Supreme Court will be left to be regulated exclusively by article 136. 11. The other amendments proposed in the Bill are mainly for removing or correcting the distortions which came into the Constitution by reason of amendments enacted during the period of the Internal Emergency. 12. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. The notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions of the Bill. ----------- ARRANGEMENT OF SECTIONS ------------- SECTIONS 1.

Although the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have made considerable progress in the last thirty years, the reasons which weighed with the Constituent Assembly in making provisions with regard to the aforesaid reservation of seats and nomination of members, have not ceased to exist. It is, therefore, proposed to continue the reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and the representation of Anglo-Indians by nomination for a further period of ten years. 2. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirtieth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Forty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1980. (2) It shall be deemed to have come into force on the 25th day of January, 1980. 2. Amendment of article 334.- In article 334 of the Constitution for the words \"thirty years\"; the words \"forty years\" shall be substituted. [The Constitution (Forty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 1980, increased the time of seat reservations for the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) as well as gave the special representation of the Anglo-Indian community in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies for a further duration of ten years, or up to January 26, 1990. Article 334 of the Constitution had originally required the reservation of seats to cease in 1960, but this was extended to 1970 by the 8th Amendment, and the 23rd Amendment extended this period to 1980. The 45th Amendment extended the period of reservation to 1990.The period of reservation was extended to 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2030 by the 62nd, 79th, 95th and 104th Amendments respectively.

       "   'data': 'Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Sales tax laws enacted in pursuance of the Government of India Act, 1935 as also the laws relating to sales tax passed after the coming into force of the Constitution proceeded on the footing that the expression \"sale of goods\", having regard to the rule as to broad interpretation of entries in the legislative lists, would be given a wider connotation. However, in Gannon Dunkerley\\'s case (A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 560), the Supreme Court held that the expression \"sale of goods\" as used in the entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. This decision related to works contracts. 2. By a series of subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court has, on the basis of the decision in Gannon Dunkerley\\'s case, held various other transactions which resemble, in substance, transactions by way of sales, to be not liable to sales tax. As a result of these decisions, a transaction, in order to be subject to the levy of sales tax under entry 92A of the Union List or entry 54 of the State List, should have the following ingredients, namely, parties competent to contract, mutual assent and transfer of property in goods from one of the parties to the contract to the other party thereto for a price. 3. This position has resulted in scope for avoidance of tax in various ways. An example of this is the practice of inter-State consignment transfers, i.e., transfer of goods from head office or a principal in one State to a branch or agent in another State or vice versa or transfer of goods on consignment account, to avoid the payment of sales tax on inter-State sales under the Central Sales Tax Act. While in the case of a works contract, if the contract treats the sale of materials separately from the cost of the labour, the sale of materials would be taxable, but in the case of an indivisible works contract, it is not possible to levy sales tax on the transfer of property in the goods involved in the execution of such contract as it has been held that there is no sale of the materials as such and the property in them does not pass as moveables. Though practically the purchaser in a hire-purchase agreement gets the goods on the date of the hire-purchase, it has been held that there is sale only when the purchaser exercises the option to purchase at a much later date and therefore only the depreciated value of the goods involved in such transaction at the time the option to purchase is exercised becomes assessable to sales tax. Similarly, while sale by a registered club or other association of persons (the club or association of persons having corporate status) to its members is taxable, sales by an unincorporated club or association of persons to its members is not taxable as such club or association, in law, has no separate existence from that of the members. In the Associated Hotels of India case (A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 1131), the Supreme Court held that there is no sale involved in the supply of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel. 4. In the New India Sugar Mills case (A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207), the Supreme Court took the view that in the transfer of controlled commodities in pursuance of a direction under a Control Order, the element of volition by the seller, or mutual assent, is absent and, therefore, there is no sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. However, in Oil and Natural Gas Commission Vs. State of Bihar (A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 2478), the Supreme Court had occasion to consider its earlier decisions with regard to the liability of transfers of controlled commodities to be charged to sales tax. The Supreme Court held that where there are any statutory compulsions, the statute itself should be treated as supplying the consensus and furnishing the modality of the consensus. In Vishnu Agencies Vs. Commercial Tax Officer (A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 449), six of the seven Judges concurred in over-ruling the decision, in New India Sugar Mills case while the seventh Judge held the case to be distinguishable. It is, therefore, considered desirable to put the matter beyond any doubt. 5. The various problems connected with the power of the States to levy a tax on the sale of goods and with the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 were referred to the Law Commission of India. The Commission considered these matters in their Sixty-first Report and, recommended, inter alia, certain amendments in the Constitution if as a matter of administrative policy it is decided to levy tax on transactions of the nature mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. 6. Device by way of lease of films has also been resulting in avoidance of sales tax. The main right in regard to a film relates to its exploitation and after exploitation for a certain period of time, in most cases, the film ceases to have any value. It is, therefore, seen that instead of resorting to the outright sale of a film, only a leased or transfer of the right to exploitation is made. 7. There were reports from State Governments to whom revenues from sales tax have been assigned, as to the large scale avoidance of Central sales tax leviable on inter-State sales of goods through the device of consignment of goods from one State to another and as to the leakage of local sales tax in works contracts, hire-purchase transactions, lease of films, etc. Though Parliament could levy a tax on these transactions, as tax on sales has all along been treated as an item of revenue to be assigned to the States, in regard to these transactions which resemble sales also, it is considered that the same policy should be adopted. 8. Besides the above mentioned matters, a new problem has arisen as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court in Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. Vs. Lt. Governor of Delhi (A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 1591). States have been proceeding on the basis that the Associated Hotels of India case was applicable only to supply of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel and that tax was leviable on the sale of foodstuffs by a restaurant. But over-ruling the decision of the Delhi High Court, the Supreme Court has held in the above case that service of meals whether in a hotel or restaurant does not constitute a sale of food for the purpose of levy of sales tax but must be regarded as the rendering of a service in the satisfaction of a human need or ministering to the bodily want of human beings. It would not make any difference whether the visitor to the restaurant is charged for the meal as a whole or according to each dish separately. 9. It is, therefore, proposed to suitably amend the Constitution to include in article 366 a definition of \"tax on the sale or purchase of goods\" by inserting a new clause (29A). The definition would specifically include within the scope of that expression tax on--- (i) transfer for consideration of controlled commodities; (ii) the transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract; (iii) delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments; (iv) transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration; (v) the supply of goods by an unincorporated association or body of persons to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration; vi) the supply, by way of or as part of any service, of food or any drink for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration. (See clause 4). 10. A new entry is sought to be inserted in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule, as entry 92B, to enable the levy of tax on the consignment of goods where such consignment takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. (See clause 5). 11. Clause (1) of article 269 is proposed to be amended so that the tax levied on the consignment of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce shall be assigned to the States. Clause (3) of that article is proposed to be amended to enable Parliament to formulate by law principles for determining when a consignment of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. (See clause 2). 12. Clause (3) of article 286 is proposed to be amended to enable Parliament to specify, by law, restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the transfer of goods involved in the execution of a works contract, on the delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments and on the right to use any goods. (See clause 3). 13. The proposed amendments would help in the augmentation of the State revenues to a considerable extent. Cluase 6 of the Bill seeks to validate laws levying tax on the supply of food or drink for consideration and also the collection or recoveries made by way of tax under any such law. However, no sales tax will be payable on food or drink supplied by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel during the period from the date of the judgment in the Associated Hotels of India case and the commencement of the present Amendment Act if the conditions mentioned in sub-clause (2) of clause 6 of the Bill are satisfied. In the case of food or drink supplied by Restaurants this relief will be available only in respect of the period after the date of judgment in the Northern India Caterers (India) Limited case and the commencement of the present Amendment Act. 14. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-third Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982. 2.

[The Constitution (Forty-Sixth Amendment) Act, 1982, states that it is the responsibility of the State to prioritize and promote the upliftment of weaker sections of society, especially Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, in the areas of education and economic interests. Across the country, different classes of society vary in their concentration of wealth and access to facilities. Access to a decent standard of living and humane conditions is a fundamental right for all citizens. Therefore, Article 46 of the Indian Constitution aims to provide a better standard of life and equal opportunities to weaker sections of society, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, by ensuring education and progressive economic conditions for them.

[The Constitution (Fifty-Second Amendment) Act, 1985, introduced as an anti-defection bill in the parliament to prohibit its members from hopping between different political parties and inserted a new Schedule in the constitution i.e. the 10th schedule. It altered the provisions of Articles 101, 102, 191, and 192. It laid down the grounds of defection for members of either house of Parliament or state assemblies or councils. It aims to prevent political defections for reasons of office and other considerations from causing harm to democracy. Its proposed solution is to bar Members of Parliament and State Legislatures who deviate from party politics from continuing to hold their political office. This was not passed without a major change in the country’s political landscape. Nevertheless, it is the highest-level document drafted by our democracy and has the potential to make Indian politics more transparent. Aside from enhancing political freedoms, this amendment also contains provisions to curb corruption. The constitution’s anti-defection provisions were a result of a series of debates over the issue.

Paragraph 4.2 of the Memorandum provides that to give effect to the decision \"all the necessary legislative and administrative measures will be undertaken, including those for the enactment of Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and other laws for the conferment of statehood as aforesaid, to come into effect on a date to be notified by the Central Government\". 2. Paragraph 4.3 of the Memorandum provides as follows:- Acts of Parliament shall not apply to the new State of Mizoram unless so decided by the Mizoram Legislature with regard to- (i) religious or social practices of Mizos; (ii) Mizo customary law and procedure; (iii) administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions according to Mizo Customary law; (iv) ownership and transfer of land.

[The Constitution (Fifty-Third Amendment) Act, 1986, aims to keep a check against unwanted interference by the Central Government. The act protects the interests of the community conduct and social relationship laws that apply to the State of Mizoram.Previously, under the Northeast Areas (Reorganization) Act, 1971, Mizoram had been declared a distinct Union territory in 1972. The region was known for instances of violent insurgency. Signing an accord for establishing Mizo peace was the only way to reinstate peace and harmony in the State. The interests of the Mizo community had to be protected. This was achieved through the insertion of Article 371G into the Indian Constitution. This came to be known as The Constitution (Fifty-Third Amendment), 1986. A treaty was finalized between the Union Government, State Government, and the Mizo National Front (MNF) on June 30, 1986.

Even though these States are predominantly tribal areas, the underlying objective of the aforesaid Act was to ensure that the members of the Scheduled Tribes in these areas do not fair to secure a minimal representation because of their inability to complete with the advanced sections of the people. 2. The Constitution (Fifty-first Amendment) Act, though formally enforced, cannot be fully implemented unless parallel action is taken to determine the seats which are to be reserved for Scheduled Tribes in these areas. The number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of any State under article 332 of the Constitution will have to be determined having regard to the provisions of article 332(3) of the Constitution. However, in view of the historical background with respect to the areas comprised in the North-Eastern States, the circumstances obtaining in these areas in the state of development of the Scheduled Tribes in these areas and other relevant considerations, it is considered necessary to provide for special arrangements with regard to the reservation for Scheduled Tribes in these areas for a temporary period so as to facilitate easy transition of these areas to the normal arrangements as envisaged in the Constitution. It is, therefore, proposed to further amend article 332 of the Constitution for making a temporary provision, until the re-adjustment of seats on the basis of the first census after the year 2000 under article 170 of the Constitution for these States, for the determination of the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes. 3. The proposed amendment seeks to provide that if all the seats in the Legislative Assembly of such States in existence on the date of coming into force of this Constitution Amendment Act are held by the members of the Scheduled Tribes, all the seats except one shall be reserved for Scheduled Tribes and in any other case such number of seats as bears to the total number of seats a proportion not less than the number of members belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the existing Assembly bears to the total number of seats in the existing Assembly. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-eighth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Fifty-seventh Amendment) Act, 1987. (2) It shall come into force on such date_675 as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2. Amendment of article 332.- (1) In article 332 of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(3A) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (3), until the taking effect, under article 170, of the re-adjustment, on the basis of the first census after the year 2000, of the number of seats in the Legislative Assemblies of the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland, the seats which shall be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of any such State shall be,- (a) if all the seats in the Legislative Assembly of such State in existence on the date of coming into force of the Constitution (Fifty-seventh Amendment) Act, 1987 (hereafter in this clause referred to as the existing assembly) are held by members of the Scheduled Tribes, all the seats except one; (b) in any other case, such number of seats as bears to the total number of seats, a proportion not less than the number (as on the said date) of members belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the existing Assembly bears to the total number of seats in the existing Assembly.\".

[The Constitution (Fifty-seventh Amendment) Act, 1987, dealt with the reservation of seats for tribal people of the North-Eastern states ( Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh ) in the Lower House of Parliament and State legislatures. This cannot be considered to be one of the major amendments but it was an important move for the upliftment of the weaker sections or those sections of society that were neglected for a very long time.

A Hindi translation of the Constitution, signed by the members of the Constituent Assembly, was also published in 1950 under the authority of the President of the Constituent Assembly in accordance with a resolution adopted by that Assembly. 2. There has been a general demand for the publication of an authoritative text of the Constitution in Hindi incorporating therein all the subsequent amendments. It is also imperative to have an authoritative text of the Constitution for facilitating its use in the legal process. Any Hindi version of the Constitution should not only conform to the Hindi translation published by the Constituent Assembly, but should also be in conformity with the language, style and terminology adopted in the authoritative texts of Central Acts in Hindi. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution so as to empower the President of India to publish under his authority the translation of the Constitution in Hindi signed by the members of the Constituent Assembly with such modifications as may be necessary to bring it in conformity with the language, style and terminology adopted in the authoritative texts of Central Acts in the Hindi language. The President would also be authorised to publish the translation in Hindi of every amendment of the Constitution made in English. 3. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-eighth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Fifty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1987. 2. Amendment of the heading of Part XXII.- In Part XXII of the Constitution, in the heading, after the word, \"COMMENCEMENT\", the words \", AUTHORITATIVE TEXT IN HINDI\" shall be inserted. 3. Insertion of new article 394A.- After article 394 of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- \"394A. Authoritative text in the Hindi language.- (1) The President shall cause to be published under his authority,- (a) the translation of this Constitution in the Hindi language, signed by the members of the Constituent Assembly, with such modifications as may be necessary to bring it in conformity with the language, style and terminology adopted in the authoritative texts of Central Acts in the Hindi language, and incorporating therein all the amendments of this Constitution made before such publication; and (b) the translation in the Hindi language of every amendment of this Constitution made in the English language. (2) The translation of this Constitution and of every amendment thereof published under clause (1) shall be construed to have the same meaning as the original thereof and if any difficulty arises in so construing any part of such translation, the President shall cause the same to be revised suitably. (3) The translation of this Constitution and of every amendment thereof published under this article shall be deemed to be, for all purposes, the authoritative text thereof in the Hindi language.\". [The Constitution (Fifty-eighth Amendment) Act, 1987, brings about changes in the way the Constitution was written. Initially, the whole constitution was written in English, but with the introduction of the 58th Amendment, the provision to have a Hindi version of the Constitution came into force. Moreover, every subsequent amendment shall also be written in Hindi along with the English language and should have the same sanctity as that of the English version. The President holds the authority to bring about any changes in the Hindi translation if it does not obey the criteria set by Central Acts regarding the language, style, and terminology.

In this context, it is proposed that the Legislative Assembly of the new State of Goa shall consist of forty members. The existing Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu has thirty elected members and three nominated members. It is intended to make this Assembly with the exclusion of two members representing Daman and Diu Districts, the provisional Legislative Assembly for the new State of Goa until elections are held on the expiry of the five year term of the existing Assembly. It is, therefore, proposed to provide that the Legislative Assembly of the new State of Goa shall consist of not less than 30 members. 2. In order to give effect to the above proposal, it is necessary to make a special provision in the Constitution. This Bill accordingly seeks to amend the Constitution. A separate Bill for the re-organisation of the existing Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu so as to form the new State of Goa is also being introduced. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-eighth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Fifty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1987.

Insertion of new article 371-I.- After article 371H of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- \"371-I. Special provision with respect to the State of Goa.- Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Legislative Assembly of the State of Goa shall consist of not less than thirty members.\". [The Constitution (fifty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1987, helped in changing the status of Goa from a Union territory to a full-fledged state. The introduction of Article371-I played a crucial role in assigning statehood identity to Goa. It helped the place become one of India’s most resided-in states and the most visited tourist attractions on a global level. As an independent state, personal growth, education, and tourism were emphasized as part of developmental projects. Konkani language was promoted. There was a gradual increase in the population. This Amendment Act also allowed Daman and Diu to attain the status of the separate Union territory of the Union of India. Also Refer ]'}],\n",

The proviso to that clause, however, enables the continuance of the levy of such tax at a rate exceeding two hundred and fifty rupees per annum in any State, municipality, etc., if in the financial year immediately preceding the commencement of Constitution there was in force in that State, municipality, etc., any such tax exceeding that rate. 2. Some of the State Governments have represented that this selling of two hundred and fifty rupees which was fixed in 1949, needs to be revised upwards taking into consideration the price rise and other factors. It is also pointed out that the profession tax has, at present, become almost regressive because of the ceiling since even people with high salaries have to pay this tax at only the maximum amount of two hundred and fifty rupees per annum. The upward revision of profession tax will also help the State Governments in raising additional resources. 3. It is accordingly proposed to amend clause (2) of article 276 of the Constitution to increase the ceiling of profession tax from two hundred and fifty rupees per annum to two thousand and five hundred rupees per annum. As the proviso to this clause is no longer relevant, it is proposed to omit it. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-ninth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.-This Act may be called the Constitution (Sixtieth Amendment) Act, 1988. 2.

It amended article 276 of the Constitution relating to taxes on professions, trades, callings and employment. Section 2 of the Act amended Clause (2) of article 276 of the Constitution to increase the ceiling of tax on professions, trades, callings and employments from Rupees 250 (equivalent to Rupees 2,400 or US$30 in 2020) per person per annum to Rupees 2500 per person per annum.

The one-year period in the case of the Proclamation made with respect to the State of Punjab is due to expire on the 10th May, 1988. In view of the continued disturbed situation in Punjab, escalation in the activities of terrorists and anti-national forces resulting in the death of innocent men, women and children and of the fact that the Punjab State Legislative Assembly had to be dissolved because of the virtual impossibility of forming a popular Government in the prevailing circumstances, the continuance in force of the said Proclamation beyond the period of one year may be necessary in Punjab. Article 356(5) of the Constitution is, therefore, proposed to be amended so as to facilitate the extension of the said Proclamation, if necessary up to a period of three years as permissible under clause (4) of that article. The continuance of the Proclamation after the 10th May, 1988 may not, it is felt, be effective as terrorist activities had been on the increase. It may be necessary to invoke the provisions of article 352 of the Constitution to declare a partial Emergence either in the whole of the State of Punjab or in particular districts of that State. If such a situation arises, the expression \"armed rebellion\" included in that article as one of the grounds for declaration of Emergency (which alone could be resorted to in the case of an Internal Emergency) may not be appropriate in the prevailing situation in Punjab to declare a Proclamation in that State. It is, therefor, felt that article 352 may be suitably amended in its application to the State of Punjab to include \"internal disturbance\" as one of the grounds that the integrity of India is threatened by internal disturbance in any part of the territory of India so as to facilitate the taking of action under that article if it becomes necessary at a future date. The expression \"internal disturbance\" was one of the grounds included in that article from the commencement of the Constitution till it was amended by the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978. Consequentially, articles 358 and 359 are also proposed to be amended so as to provide for the automatic suspension of article 19 of the Constitution and the issuing of an order by the President suspending the operation of any of the other provisions contained in Part III (except article 20) under article 359, if and when a Proclamation of Emergency on the ground of internal disturbance is issued in relation to the whole or any part of the State of Punjab. As the proposed amendments are only for the purpose of curbing the terrorist activities in the State of Punjab more effectively, the powers that are proposed to be conferred by these amendments would not be resorted to for any period beyond what is absolutely necessary for achieving the aforesaid object. Accordingly, the amendments proposed in articles 352, 358 and 359 have been made to be operative only for a period of two years from the commencement of this Amendment. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Thirty-ninth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.-This Act may be called the Constitution (Fifty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1988. 2.

Insertion of new article 359A.- (1) After article 359 of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:- `359A. Application of this Part to the State of Punjab.- Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, this Part shall, in relation to the State of Punjab, be subject to the following modifications, namely:- (a) in article 352,- (i) in clause (1),- (A) for the opening portion, the following shall be substituted, namely:- \"If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby- (a) the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened, whether by war or external aggression or armed rebellion; or (b) the integrity of India is threatened by internal disturbance in the whole or any part of the territory of Punjab, he may, by Proclamation, make a declaration to that effect in respect of the whole of Punjab or of such part of the territory thereof as may be specified in the Proclamation.\"; (B) in the Explanation,- (1) after the words \"armed rebellion\", the words \", or that the integrity of India is threatened by internal disturbance in the whole or any part of the territory of Punjab,\" shall be inserted; (2) after the words \"or rebellion\", the words \"or disturbance\" shall be inserted; (ii) in clause (9), after the words \"armed rebellion\", at both the places where they occur, the words \"or internal disturbance\" shall be inserted; (b) in article 358, in clause (1), after the words \"or by external aggression\", the words \"or by armed rebellion, or that the integrity of India is threatened by internal disturbance in the whole or any part of the territory of Punjab,\" shall be inserted; (c) in article 359, for the words and figures \"articles 20 and 21\", at both the places where they occur, the word and figures \"article 20\" shall be substituted.\\'.

Under this act, Article 356 of the Indian Constitution was amended to allow the President’s rule in the state of Punjab for a period of up to three years as previously, the maximum period for this rule was two years.

It has been found that many of the countries have specified 18 years as the voting age. In our country some of the State Governments have adopted 18 years of age for elections to the local authorities. The present-day youth are literate and enlightened and the lowering of the voting age would provide to the unrepresented youth of the country an opportunity to give vent to their feelings and help them become a part of the political process.

The voting age for an Indian citizen was decided as 21 years on the basis of adult suffrage. In simple words, any person below the age of 21 was not allowed to cast a vote in the elections for the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly of each State.

[The Constitution (Sixty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1990, was enacted in 1990 by amending the 9th schedule, which was added by the 1st Amendment and established by Article 31B. According to the 9th schedule, all the Central and State laws in the list cannot face legal challenges. As per this amendment of the Indian constitution Act, 55 land reforms were included in the 9th schedule by various States to protect them from judicial scrutiny. Considering the fact that amendment to Acts currently in the Ninth Schedule is also not exempt from the judicial challenge, some modifying Acts are also recommended to be incorporated into the Ninth Schedule. By including them in the 9th Schedule to the Constitution, the Act shields 55 State acts relating to land reforms and caps on agricultural land holdings that were passed by the States of Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and administration of the Union Territory of Puducherry from legal challenge.

On reconsideration, the Government is of the view that there is no need for the special powers in regard to the Proclamation of Emergency in Punjab as envisaged in the amendment. It is also considered that the amendment to article 356 made by the said Act is no longer needed. It is, therefore, considered that the amendments made by the aforesaid Act should be repealed. 3.

To address the deteriorating terrorist threat in Punjab, the government intended to declare an emergency under the 59th Amendment to the Constitution, which was hurriedly passed by both houses of Parliament. When considered essential, it gave the Central Government the power to declare an emergency in Punjab. The amendment guarantees an extension of a maximum of three years of the President’s rule.

       "   'data': 'Statament of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Seventy-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1992 (Bill No. XXX of 1992) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Seventieth Amendment) Act, 1992 STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS While considering the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1991 and the Government of National Capital Territory Bill, 1991, views were expressed in both the Houses of Parliament in favour of including also the elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of Union territories in the electoral college for the election of the President under article 54 of the Constitution. At present article 54 relating to the election of the President provides for an electoral college consisting of only the elected Members of Parliament as well as the Legislative Assemblies of the States (not Union territories). Similarly, article 55 providing for the manner of such election also speaks of Legislative Assemblies of States. Accordingly, an Explanation is sought to be inserted in article 54 to provide that reference to \"State\" in articles 54 and 55 would include the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union territory of Pondicherry for constituting the electoral college for election of the President. This would enable the elected members of the Legislative Assembly created for the Union territory of Pondicherry under the provisions of article 239A and of the proposed Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi under article 239AA to be included in the electoral college. 2. THE CONSTITUTION (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1991 which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 received assent of the President on 21st December, 1991. The said Bill as originally introduced in the Lok Sabha sought to incorporate in article 239AA a sub-clause (b) to clause (7). This proposed sub-clause was subsequently dropped since inclusion of the said sub-clause would have necessitated ratification of the Bill by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States and thereby delayed the early constitution of a Legislative Assembly for the Union territory of Delhi. The said sub-clause (clause 3 of the present Bill) is sought to be inserted in the present Constitution (Amendment) Bill with retrospective effect i.e. from 21st December, 1991. Ratification by States is also proposed to be obtained for the clause along with ratification for the other clause of the Bill which seeks to amend article 54. 3. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Forty-third Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Seventieth Amendment) Act, 1992. (2) Section 3 of this Act shall be deemed to have come into force on the 21st day of December, 1991 and section 2 shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2. Amendment of article 54.- In article 54 of the Constitution, the following Explanation shall be inserted at the end, namely:- `Explanation.-In this article and in article 55, \"State\" includes the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union territory of Pondicherry.\\'. 3. Amendment of article 239AA.- In article 239AA of the Constitution,- (i) in clause (7), for the brackets and figure \"(7)\", the brackets, figure and letter \"(7) (a)\" shall be substituted; (ii) in clause (7) as so amended, the following sub-clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(b) Any such law as is referred to in sub-clause (a) shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of article 368 notwithstanding that it contains any provision which amends or has the effect of amending, this Constitution.\". [The Constitution (Seventieth Amendment) Act, 1992, incorporated the elected members of the Pondicherry Legislative Assembly into the President’s Electoral College.

Article 40 of the Constitution which enshrines one of the Directive Principles of State Policy lays down that the State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. In the light of the experience in the last forty years and in view of the short-comings which have been observed, it is considered that there is an imperative need to enshrine in the Constitution certain basic and essential features of Panchayati Raj Institutions to impart certainty, continuity and strength to them. 3. Accordingly, it is proposed to add a new Part relating to Panchayats in the Constitution to provide for among other things, Gram Sabha in a village or group of villages; constitution of Panchayats at village and other level or levels; direct elections to all seats in Panchayats at the village and intermediate level, if any, and to the offices of Chairpersons of Panchayats at such levels; reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for membership of Panchayats and office of Chairpersons in Panchayats at each level; reservation of not less than one-third of the seats for women; fixing tenure of 5 years for Panchayats and holding elections within a period of 6 months in the event of supersession of any Panchayat; disqualifications for membership of Panchayats; devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Panchayats with respect to the preparation of plans for economic developments and social justice and for the implementation of development schemes; sound finance of the Panchayats by securing authorisation from State Legislatures for grants-in-aid to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State, as also assignment to, or appropriation by, the Panchayats of the revenues of designated taxes, duties, tolls and fees; setting up of a Finance Commission within one year of the proposed amendment and thereafter every 5 years to review the financial position of Panchayats; auditing of accounts of the Panchayats; powers of State Legislatures to make provisions with respect to elections to Panchayats under the superintendence, direction and control of the chief electoral officer of the State; application of the provisions of the said Part to Union territories; excluding certain States and areas from the application of the provisions of the said Part; continuance of existing laws and Panchayats until one year from the commencement of the proposed amendment and barring interference by courts in electoral matters relating to Panchayats. 4.

It introduced the concept of gram panchayats, which is a third-level government that deals directly with the public and works to address problems at the grass-roots level. Article 243 (b) defines the gram sabha, which consists of persons registered on the electoral rolls. It is the basic unit of the Panchayati Raj Institution. This institution is empowered to perform various functions at the village level, including establishing schools and health facilities. This act granted constitutional status to panchayats and democratized decentralization. It also empowered panchayats at all levels to levy taxes and collect duties. It further ensures that people at the grassroots level are more engaged in the governance process. It focused on improving rural political structures and the rights of vulnerable populations. The Act emphasized the need for women to be a part of local government structures. This law made it simpler for women to get involved in politics by giving them greater possibilities. The act also made women eligible to serve as Panchayat members. This amendment Act of Indian Constitution also made provisions for reserving seats for SC/ST/OBC communities and women in the legislature. In addition, it removed the upper population limit in parliamentary constituencies. Also Refer ]'},\n",

As a result, Urban Local Bodies are not able to perform effectively as vibrant democratic units of self-government. 2.

[The Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, dealt with the devolution of power into the systems of Municipalities or Urban Local Governments. It mandated the setting up and devolution of powers to Urban local bodies (ULBs) or city governments as the lowest unit of governance in cities and towns. This landmark initiative of the Government of India was built upon the premise that all ‘power’ in a democracy rightfully belongs to ‘the people’. Power was mandated to be given to the people via the local bodies (referred to as municipalities), namely Municipal Corporations, Councils and Nagar Panchayats, which would have representatives that are elected regularly and have a decisive role in planning, provision and delivery of services. This Act prescribes institutional changes as well, with the setting up of Ward Committees, District Planning Committees and Metropolitan Planning Committees to coordinate planning across jurisdictions, as well as the setting up of State Election Commissions and State Financial Commissions. Effectively, this act gives ULBs a role much larger than just that of service providers that provide water, waste management, electricity, and so on. Also Refer ]'},\n",

The said Memorandum provides for a greater share of tribals in the governance of the State. The said Memorandum envisages amendment of the Constitution to provide that notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution, the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tripura reserved for Scheduled Tribes shall be, such number of seats as bears to the total number of seats, a proportion not less than the number, as on the date of coming into force of the Constitutional amendment, of members belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the existing Assembly bears to the total number of seats in the existing Assembly. It also provides that the amendments shall not affect any representation in the existing Assembly of the State of Tripura until its dissolution. 2. In order to implement the said Memorandum, action is to be taken to determine the seats which are to be reserved for Scheduled Tribes in the State of Tripura. Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of any State is governed by the provisions of article 332 of the Constitution. Having regard to the special circumstances obtaining in the State of Tripura, it is proposed to further amend article 332 of the Constitution for making a temporary provision for the determination of the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes until the re-adjustment of seats on the basis of the first census after the year 2000 under article 170 of the Constitution for the State of Tripura. 3.

Some of the deleterious legal consequences include mounting and unending litigation, inability of the courts to provide timely justice, evolution of practices and systems to by pass the operations of rent legislations and steady shrinkage of rental housing market. 2. The Supreme Court, taking note of the precarious state of rent litigation in the country, in the case of Prabhakaran Nair and others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu (Civil Writ Petition 506 of 1986 and other writs) observed that the Supreme Court and the High Courts should be relieved of the heavy burden of rent litigation. Tiers of appeals should be curtailed. Laws should be simple, rational and clear. Litigations must come to end quickly. The idea of a National Rent Tribunal on an all-India basis with quicker procedure should be examined. 3. It is proposed to amend article 323B in Part XIVA of the Constitution so as to give timely relief to the rent litigants by providing for setting up of State-level Rent Tribunals in order to reduce the tiers of appeals and to exclude the jurisdiction of all courts, except that of the Supreme Court, under article 136 of the Constitution. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objects. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Forty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1.

Amendment of article 323B.-In article 323B of the Constitution, in clause (2),- (a) sub-clauses (h) and (i) shall be re-lettered as sub-clauses (i) and (j), and before sub-clause (i), as so re-lettered, the following sub-clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(h) rent, its regulation and control and tenancy issues including the right, title and interest of landlords and tenants;\"; (b) in sub-clause (i), as so re-lettered, for the brackets and letter \"(g)\", the brackets and letter \"(h)\" shall be substituted; (c) in sub-clause (j), as so re-lettered, for the brackets and letter \"(h)\", the brackets and letter \"(i)\" shall be substituted. [The Constitution (Seventy-fifth Amendment) Act, 1993, contains provisions for the establishment of rent control tribunals and amended article 323B. The Indian Constitution has made provisions for setting up State-level Rent Tribunals, which will provide timely relief to rent litigants.

The extent of reservation has been increased by the State Government from time to time, consistent with the needs of the majority of the people and it has now reached the level of 69 per cent. (18 per cent. Scheduled Castes, 1 per cent. Scheduled Tribes and 50 per cent. Other Backward Classes). 2. The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Indira Sawhney and others Vs. Union of India and Others (AIR 1993 SC 477) on 16th November, 1992, holding that the total reservations under article 16(4) should not exceed 50 per cent. 3. The issue of admission to educational institutions for the academic year 1993-94 came up before the High Court of Madras in a writ petition. The High Court of Madras held that the Tamil Nadu Government could continue its reservation policy as hitherto followed during that academic year and that the quantum of reservation should be brought down to 50 per cent. during the academic year 1994-95. The Government of Tamil Nadu had filed a Special Leave Petition against the High Court of Madras in order that the present reservation policy of the State Government should be reaffirmed so as to ensure to continue advancement of the Backward Classes. However, the Supreme Court of India passed an interim order reiterating that the reservation should not exceed 50 per cent. in the matter of admission to educational institutions. 4. In the special Session of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly held on 9th November, 1993, it had been unanimously resolved to call upon the Central Government to take steps immediately to bring a suitable amendment to the Constitution of India as to enable the Government of Tamil Nadu to continue its policy of 69 per cent. reservation in Government Services and for admission in Educational Institutions as at present. An all parties meeting had also been held on 26th November, 1993 in Tamil Nadu urging that there should not be any doubt or delay in ensuring the continued implementation of 69 per cent. reservation for the welfare and advancement of the backward classes. 5. The Tamil Nadu Government enacted a legislation namely Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and of appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Bill, 1993 and forwarded it to the Government of India for consideration of the President of India in terms of article 31-C of the Constitution. 6. In view of the importance and sensitive nature of the matter, the Union Home Minister held meetings with the leaders of Political Parties on 13th July, 1994 to discuss the provisions of the Bill. The general consensus among the leaders was that the Bill should be assented to. Accordingly, the President gave his assent to the Bill on 19th July, 1994. 7. The Tamil Nadu Government accordingly notified the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of appointment or posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993 as Act No. 45 of 1994 on 19th July, 1994. 8. The Tamil Nadu Government requested the Government of India on 22nd July, 1994 that the aforementioned Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994 be included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution of India for the reasons given below:- \"The said Act attracts article 31C of the Constitution, as falling within the purview of clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and articles 38 and 46 of the Constitution-vide section 2 of the Act. The Act has been passed relying on the directive principles of State Policy enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution and in particular, articles 38, 39 (b) and (c) and 46 of the Constitution. As the Act is to give effect to the directive principles of State Policy contained, inter alia, in article 39(b) and (c), the said Act will get the protection of article 31C of the Constitution and therefore, cannot be challenged under articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution, with reference to which article 14, the reservation exceeding 50 per cent. has been struck down by the Supreme Court. Now it has been decided to address the Government of India for including the Act in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, so that the law cannot be challenged as violative of any of the fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution including articles 15 and 16, and gets protection under article 31B of the Constitution.\" 9. The Government of India has already supported the provision of the State legislation by giving the President\\'s assent to the Tamil Nadu Bill. As a corollary to this decision, it is now necessary that the Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994 is brought within the purview of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution so that it gets protection under article 31B of the Constitution in regard to the judicial review. 10. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforementioned objective. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Forty-fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Seventy-sixth Amendment) Act, 1994. 2. Amendment of the Ninth Schedule.- In the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, after entry 257 and before the Explanation, the following entry shall be inserted, namely:- \"257A. The Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993 (Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994).\". [The Constitution (Seventy-sixth Amendment) Act, 1994, allows the continuation of the 69% reservation in Tamil Nadu by adding the relevant Tamil Nadu Act to the Constitution’s 9th Schedule.This constitutional amendment modifies schedule 9 of the Indian Constitution. It deals with reserving seats in educational institutions and appointments or posts in state-run services for members of backward classes, scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes. On November 16, 1992, the Supreme Court of India established a ceiling of 50% on the total percentage of reservations permitted under Article 16(4) of the Constitution. Also Refer ]'}],\n",

The Supreme Court in its judgment dated 16th November, 1992 in the case of Indra Sawhney and Others vs. Union of India and Others, however, observed that reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) of the Constitution is confined to initial appointment and cannot extent to reservation in the matter of promotion. This ruling of the Supreme Court will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Since the representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services in the States have not reached the required level, it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interest of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, the Government have decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. To carry out this, it is necessary to amend article 16 of the Constitution by inserting a new clause (4A) in the said article to provide for reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. 2. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Forty-sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title.- This Act may be called the Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995. 2. Amendment of article 16.- In article 16 of the Constitution, after clause (4), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:- \"(4A) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the services under the State.\". [The Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995, broadened the reservation provisions for job promotions, encompassing individuals belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Since 1955, the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) have had access to the facility of reservation in the promotion. However, the Supreme Court stated in its decision dated November 16, 1992, in the issue of Indra Sawhney and Others vs. Union of India and Others that reservation of appointments or posts under Article 16(4) of the Constitution is restricted to initial appointment. Further, it cannot extend to a reservation in matters of promotion. The interests of the SC and STs will be harmed by this Supreme Court decision. It is vital to continue the current dispensation of offering reservations in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes since their representation in services in the States has not achieved the requisite level. The government has chosen to maintain the prevailing policy of reservations in the promotion of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in light of its commitment to safeguarding the interests of these groups. To achieve this, it is necessary to change Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. This is accomplished by adding a new clause (4A) to the aforementioned article that establishes a reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).

The Schedule consists of list of laws enacted by various State Governments and Central Government which inter alia affect rights and interest in property including land. 2. In the past, whenever it was found that progressive legislation conceived in the interest of the public was imperilled by litigation, recourse was taken to the Ninth Schedule. Accordingly, several State enactments relating to land reforms and ceiling on agricultural land holdings have already been included in the Ninth Schedule. Since the Government is committed to give importance to land reforms, it has been certain decided to include land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule so that they are not challenged before the Courts. The State Governments of Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan; Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have suggested the inclusion of some of their Acts relating to land reforms in the Ninth Schedule. 3.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Prior to August, 29, 1997, the vacancies reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, which could not be filled up by direct recruitment on account of non-availability of the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, were treated as \"Backlog Vacancies\". These vacancies were treated as a distinct group and were excluded from the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation. The Supreme Court of India in its judgment in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservations in a year including carried forward reservations should in no case exceed the limit of fifty per cent. As total reservations in a year for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the other Backward Classes combined together had already reached forty-nine and a half per cent and the total number of vacancies to be filled up in a year could not exceed fifty per cent., it became difficult to fill the \"Backlog Vacancies\" and to hold Special Recruitment Drives. Therefore, to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court, an Official Memorandum dated August 29, 1997 was issued to provide that the fifty per cent limit shall apply to current as well as \"Backlog Vacancies\" and for discontinuation of the Special Recruitment Drive. 2. Due to the adverse effect of the aforesaid order dated August 29, 1997, various organisations including the Members of Parliament represented to the central Government for protecting the interest of the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The Government, after considering various representations, reviewed the position and has decided to make amendment in the constitution so that the unfilled vacancies of a year, which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4A) of article 16 of the Constitution, shall be considered as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty percent. Reservation on total number of vacancies of that year. This amendment in the Constitution would enable the State to restore the position as was prevalent before august 29, 1997. 3. That Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid object. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fiftieth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- 1. Short title: This Act may be called the Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000. 2. Amendment of article 16: In article 16 of the Constitution, for clause (4A), the following clauses shall be inserted, namely: - \"(4B) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year\". [[The Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000, aimed to protect reservations for SCs and STs in the backlog of vacancies. A new clause (4B) was added to Article 16 of the Constitution of India by the 81st Amendment Act of 2000, after clause (4A). This gave the states the authority to treat unfilled reserved vacancies from one year as a separate class of vacancies to be filled in the following year or years. The new provision stated that such vacancies must not be included in the vacancies of the year in which they are filled, in order to calculate the overall vacancy reservation ceiling of 50% for that year. This modification essentially eliminated the 50% cap on reservations for backlog vacancies. Also Refer ]'},\n",

The Supreme Court in its judgment dated 1-10-1996 in the case of S. Vinod Kumar Vs. Union India held that such relaxations in matters of reservation in promotion were not permissible under article 16(4) of the Constitution in view of the command contained in article 335 of the Constitution. The Apex Court also held that the law on the subject of relaxations of qualifying marks and standards of evaluation in matters of reservation in promotion is one laid down by the nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Indira Sawhney and others Vs. Union of India and others. Para 831 of Indira Sawhney judgment also held such relaxations as being not permissible under article 16(4) in view of the command contained in article 335 of the Constitution. In order to implement the judgments of the Supreme Court, such relaxations had to be withdrawn with effect from 22.07.1997. 2. In view of the adverse effect of the order dated 22.07.1997 on the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, representations had been received by the Government from several quarters including the Members of Parliament.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The Tenth Finance Commission had submitted its report on the 26th November, 1994 for the period of five years, i.e.,from 1995-96 to 1999-2000. The said report was laid on the table of both the Houses of Parliament on the 14th March,1995. One of the recommendations of the Commission that has been under consideration of the Government is an alternative scheme of sharing of the proceeds of certain Union taxes and duties between the Union and the States. 2. The alternative scheme envisages that twenty-six per cent out of the gross proceeds of Union taxes and duties (excluding stamp duty, excise duty on medicinal toilet preparations, Central Sales Tax,Consignment tax, cesses levied for specific purposes under any law made by Parliament and Surcharge) is to be assigned to the States in lieu of their existing share in income-tax, basic excise duties, special excise duties and grants in lieu of tax on railway passenger fares. 3. In addition, three per cent share in the gross proceeds of all Central taxes and duties (excluding stamp duty, excise duty on medicinal/toilet preparations, Central Sales Tax, Consignment tax, cesses levied for specific purpose under any law made by Parliament and Surcharge) is to be assigned to the States in lieu of their existing share in Additional Excise Duties in lieu of Sales Tax on tobacco, cotton and sugar. The commission had proposed that tobacco, cotton and sugar may continue to be exempt from Sales Tax and the Additional Excise Duties in lieu of Sales Tax on these items may be merged with the Basic Excise Duties. 4. Whether the alternative scheme would be more gainful to the Centre or to the States vis--vis existing arrangements would entirely depend on the relative growth in the Collection of various Central taxes and duties to be pooled. 5. The benefits of the scheme have been listed by the Commission in para 13.2. and 13.3 and 13.18 of their reports. These areas follows:- (i) with a given share being allotted to the States in the aggregate revenues from Central taxes, the States will be able to share the aggregate buoyancy of Central taxes; (ii) the Central Government can pursue tax reforms without the need to consider whether a tax is sharable in the states or not; (iii) the impact of fluctuations in Central tax revenues would be felt alike by the Central and the State Governments; (iv) Should the taxes mentioned in articles 268 and/or 269 from part of this arrangement, there will be greater likelihood of their being tapped; and (v) the progress of reforms will be greatly facilitated if the ambit of tax sharing arrangement is enlarged so as to give greater certainty of resource flows to, and increased flexibility in tax reform. 6. The above scheme recommended by the Commission is in national interest as it helps to remove a perceived inter-tax in the tax mobilisation effort of the Government of India while leaving sufficient flexibility for meeting Centres exclusive needs by keeping Cesses and Surcharges outside the pooling arrangement. 7. A Discussion Paper bringing out various aspects of the scheme was laid on the table of both the Houses of Parliament on the 20th December, 1996 with a view to generate an informed debate. 8. On the basis of a consensus reached in the Third Meeting of the inter-State Council held on the 17th July, 1997, the then Government had agreed in principle to accept the scheme recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission subject to certain modifications. 9. The Government had decided to ratify the decision taken by the previous Government according in principle approval for the scheme recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission with some modifications. 10. Firstly, the percentage share of State is to be reviewed by the successive Finance Commissions instead of freezing it for fifteen years as suggested by the Tenth Finance Commission. 11. Secondly, Government had decided to change the sharing of gross proceeds as recommended by the Tenth Finance Commission to the sharing of net proceeds in order to maintain consistency between articles 270, 279 and 280 of the Constitution. However, this will not result in any consequent loss to the States because the Government has also simultaneously decided to compensate the States by suitably enhancing the percentage share beyond 29%. 12. Thirdly, as intended by the Commission, no amendment is sought to be done in article 271, which authorize the Central Government to levy surcharge on Central taxes and duties for the purpose of the Union. 13. The scheme will be effective from 1st April, 1996. The percentage share of net proceeds during 1996-97 to 1999-2000 will be such that the States share is 29% of the gross proceeds. The recommendations of the 11th Finance Commission, which has been mandated to give its final report by 30th June, 2000, will cover the 5 years period w.e.f. 1st April, 2000. 14. In order to implement this decision, this Bill seeks to amend article 269, 270 and 272 of the Constitution so as to bring several Central taxes and duties like Corporation tax and Customs duties at par with personal income-tax as far as their constitutionally mandated sharing with the States is concerned.

The said Act provided that within one year from date of commencement of that Act, all the States shall amend their local laws to bring them in conformity with the new provisions under the Constitution. This exercise will required to be completed before the 23rd April, 1994. 2. Article 243D provides for reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in every Panchayat. Arunachal Pradesh is a State inhabited fully by indigenous tribal people. No Scheduled Castes exist in the State. No reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes has been made in the State Legislative Assembly and no provisions exist under any law to that effect. There is also no reservation for the Scheduled Castes in State Government services. 3. The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873 and the Chin Hill Regulations, 1896 provide special protection and safeguard for the peaceful existence of the indigenous tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh. These laws probihit the entry of outsiders in the tribal area without \"Inner Line Permit\". Only the indigenous tribal people are allowed to participate in the democratic process. 4. The tribal society in Arunachal Pradesh is, casteless where social equality among men and women has prevailed over centuries and ages. Since no Scheduled Castes exist in the State and the State of Arunachal Pradesh is singularly free from the caste system, it is proposed to insert a new clause (3A) in article 243M of the Constitution of India, to exempt the State of Arunachal Pradesh from the application of article 243D relating to the reservation of seats in Panchayats for the Scheduled Castes. 5. This will provide a legal and constitutional basis for Panchayat Raj Institutions in Arunachal Pradesh in accordance with the socio-political ethos of the State. 6. The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objective. An Act further to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-first Year of the Republic of India as follows: 1. Short title: This Act may be called the Constitution (Eighty-third Amendment) Act, 2000 2. Amendment of article 243M: In article 243M of the Constitution, after clause (3), the following clause shall be inserted namely:- \"(3A) Nothing in article 243D, relating to reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes, shall apply to the State of Arunachal Pradesh.\". [The Constitution (Eighty-third Amendment) Act, 1992, removed the requirement for reservation of seats in Panchayats for members of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. This state is exclusively composed of members of tribal societies. Under the new law, the state\\'s name was changed to Arunachal Pradesh Tribal Development Council. Also Refer ]'},\n",

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Provisos to articles 82 and 170 (3) of the Constitution provide that no fresh readjustment of constituencies can be undertaken until the figures of the first census taken after the year 2000 are published. These provisos were inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 as a measure to boost family planning norms. Since the first census to be taken after the year 2000 has already begun, the constitutional embargo on undertaking fresh delimitation will lapse as soon as the figures of this census are published. 2. There have been consistent demands, both for and against undertaking the exercise of fresh delimitation. Keeping in view the progress of family planning programmes in different parts of the country, the Government, as part of the National Population Policy strategy, recently decided to extend the current freeze on undertaking fresh delimitation up to the year 2026 as a motivational measure to enable the State Government to pursue the agenda for population stabilisation. 3. Government has also decided to undertake readjustment and rationalization of territorial constituencies in the States, without altering the number of seats allotted to each State in the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies of the States, including the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes constituencies, on the basis of the population ascertained at the census for the year 1991, so as to remove the imbalance caused due to uneven growth of population/electorate in different constituencies. 4.

       "   'data': 'STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 1. Demands have been made from time to time in certain quarters for strengthening and amending the Anti-defection Law as contained in the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India, on the ground that these provisions have not been able to achieve the desired goal of checking defections. The Tenth Schedule has also been criticised on the ground that it allows bulk defections while declaring individual defections as illegal. The provisions for exemption from disqualification in case of splits as provided in paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India has, in particular, come under severe criticism on account of its destablilising effect on the Government. 2. The Committee on Electoral Reforms (Dinesh Goswami Committee) in its report of May, 1990, the Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on “Reform of Electoral Laws” (1999) and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) in its report of March 31, 2002 have, inter alia, recommended omission of said paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India pertaining to exemption from disqualification in case of splits. The NCRWC is also of the view that a defector should be penalised for his action by debarring him from holding any public office as a Minister or any other remunerative political post for at least the duration of the remaining term of the existing Legislature or until, the next fresh elections whichever is earlier. It is proposed to accept these suggestions. 3. The NCRWC has also observed that abnormally large Councils of Ministers were being constituted by various Governments at Centre and States and this practice had to be prohibited by law and that a ceiling on the number of Ministers in a State or the Union Government be fixed at the maximum of 10% of the total strength of the popular House of the Legislature. 4. In the light of the above, it is proposed to amend the Constitution by omitting paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India and to provide that the size of the Council of Ministers should not be more than 10% of the strength of House or Houses concerned whether Unicameral or Bicameral. However, in case of smaller States like Sikkim, Mizoram and Goa having 32, 40 and 40 Members in the Legislative Assemblies respectively, a minimum strength of seven Ministers is proposed. 5.

(1B) A member of either House of Parliament belonging to any political party who is disqualified for being a member of that House under paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule shall also be disqualified to be appointed as a Minister under clause (1) for duration of the period commencing from the date of his disqualification till the date on which the term of his office as such member would expire or where he contest any election to either House of Parliament before the expiry of suc period, till the date on which he is declared elected, whichever i earlier.”. 3. Amendment of article 164. In article 164 of the Constitution, after clause (1), the following clauses shall be inserted, namely:-- “(1A) The total number of Ministers, including the Chief Minister, in the Council of Ministers in a State shall not exceed fifteen percent of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly of that State: Provided that the number of Ministers, including Chief Minister in a State shall not be less than twelve: Provided further that where the total number of Ministers including the Chief Minister in the Council of Ministers in any State at the commencement of the Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003 exceeds the said fifteen per cent. or the number specified in the first proviso, as the case may be, then, the total number of Ministers in that State shall be brought in conformity with the provisions of this clause within six months from such date as the President may by public notification appoint. (1B) A member of Legislative Assembly of a State or either House of the Legislature of a State having Legislative Council belonging to any political party who is disqualified for being a member of that House under paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule shall also be disqualified to be appointed as a Minister under clause (1) for duration of the period commencing from the date of his disqualification till the date on which the term of his office as such member would expire or where he contests any election to the Legislative Assembly of a State or either House of the Legislature of a State having Legislative Council, as the case may be, before the expiry of such period, till the date on which he is declared elected, whichever is earlier.”. 4.

Received the assent of the President on January 12, 2012 and published in the Gazette of India, Extra., Part II, Section 1, dated 13th January, 2012, pp. 1–5, No. 12 Prefatory Note-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The co-operative sector, over the years, has made significant contribution to various sectors of national economy and has achieved voluminous growth. However, it has shown weaknesses in safeguarding the interests of the members and fulfilment of objects for which these institutions were organised. There have been instances where elections have been postponed indefinitely and nominated office bearers or administrators remaining in-charge of these institutions for a long time. This reduces the accountability of the management of co-operative societies to their members. Inadequate professionalism in management in many of the co-operative institutions has led to poor services and low productivity. Co-operatives need to run on well established democratic principles and elections held on time and in a free and fair manner. Therefore, there is a need to initiate fundamental reforms to revitalize these institutions in order to ensure their contribution in the economic development of the country and to serve the interests of members and public at large and also to ensure their autonomy, democratic functioning and professional management. 2. The \"co-operative societies\" is a subject enumerated in Entry 32 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the State Legislatures have accordingly enacted legislations on co-operative societies. Within the framework of State Acts, growth of co-operatives on large scale was envisaged as part of the efforts for securing social and economic justice and equitable distribution of the fruits of development. It has, however, been experienced that in spite of considerable expansion of co-operatives, their performance in qualitative terms has not been up to the desired level. Considering the need for reforms in the Co-operative Societies Acts of the States, consultations with the State Governments have been held at several occasions and in the conferences of State Co-operative Ministers. A strong need has been felt for amending the Constitution so as to keep the co-operatives free from unnecessary outside interferences and also to ensure their autonomous organisational set up and their democratic functioning. 3. The Central Government is committed to ensure that the co-operative societies in the country function in a democratic, professional, autonomous and economically sound manner. With a view to bring the necessary reforms, it is proposed to incorporate a new Part in the Constitution so as to provide for certain provisions covering the vital aspects of working of co-operative societies like democratic, autonomous and professional functioning. A new article is also proposed to be inserted in Part IV of the Constitution (Directive Principles of State Policy) for the States to endeavour to promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control and professional management of co-operative societies. The proposed new Part in the Constitution, inter alia, seeks to empower the Parliament in respect of multi-State co-operative societies and the State Legislatures in case of other co-operative societies to make appropriate law, laying down the following matters, namely- (a) provisions for incorporation, regulation and winding up of co-operative societies based on the principles of democratic member-control, member-economic participation and autonomous functioning; (b) specifying the maximum number of directors of a co-operative society to be not exceeding twenty-one members; (c) providing for a fixed term of five years from the date of election in respect of the elected members of the board and its office bearers; (d) providing for a maximum time limit of six months during which a board of directors of co-operative society could be superseded or kept under suspension; (e) providing for independent professional audit; (f) providing for right of information to the members of the co-operative societies; (g) empowering the State Governments to obtain periodic reports of activities and accounts of co-operative societies; (h) providing for the reservation of one seat for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes and two seats for women on the board of every co-operative society, which have individuals as members from such categories; (i) providing for offences relating to co-operative societies and penalties in respect of such offences. 4. It is expected that these provisions will not only ensure the autonomous and democratic functioning of co-operatives, but also ensure the accountability of management to the members and other stakeholders and shall provide for deterrence for violation of the provisions of the law. 5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives. 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Ninety-seventh Amendment) Act, 2011. (2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2.

[The Constitution (Ninety-seventh Amendment) Act, 2011,was proposed to overcome the difficulties faced by Cooperative societies and improve their performance and status in the country. The extensive establishment of cooperatives was envisioned as one of the attempts to achieve social and economic justice and the equitable distribution of the advantages of progress. According to this Amendment, these societies are given constitutional status and are legally protected while also maintaining their autonomous or democratic functioning. The Constitution was amended to require that the states guarantee the autonomy of cooperatives, and as a result, state governments are now required to support the voluntary formation, autonomous decision-making, democratic control, and operation of cooperatives. The Act witnessed many changes such as modification in Part III of Article 19(1)(c) with the insertion of the words “or co-operative societies”, and the addition of Article 43B (working towards enhancing the co-Operative Societies’ Voluntary formation, independent operation, and professional management) and Part IX B to the Indian Constitution. However, the 97th Amendment faced challenges in the High Court of Gujarat as the Parliament didn’t ask for approval from the state legislatures before passing the bill. The ratification/approval is necessary for matters concerning states and since the cooperative societies are a part of the state legislature, ratification was required. On July 20, 2021, the Supreme Court of India declared the 97th Amendment Act Unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court ratification from states was necessary to pass the amendment which didn’t take place. The Supreme Court also said that the responsibility of Multistate Co-Operative societies is of the Centre while that of the State co-operative societies is of the state. As of the current scenario,  parts of the 97th Amendment on cooperatives are struck down. Also Refer ]'}],\n",

The Government of Karnataka has also endorsed the need for special provisions for the region. The resolutions seek to accelerate development of the most backward region of the State and promote inclusive growth with a view to reducing inter-district and inter-regional disparities in the State. 2. The special provisions aim to establish an institutional mechanism for equitable allocation of funds to meet the development needs over the said region, as well as to enhance human resources and promote employment from the region by providing for local cadres in service and reservation in educational and vocational training institutions by an amendment to the Constitution of India. 3. It is accordingly proposed to insert a new Article 371-J in the Constitution to provide for special provisions for the erstwhile Hyderabad-Karnataka areas of the State of Karnataka which consist of the districts of Gulbarga, Bidar, Raichur, Koppal and Yadgir and additionally include the Bellary District. The article in the form of a special provision seeks to provide for- (a) establishment of a separate Development Board for the aforesaid region mentioned above; (b) provide for equitable allocation of funds for development over the said region subject to the requirements of the State as a whole; (c) provide reservation in public employment through the constitution of local cadres for domiciles of the region; and (d) provide for reservation in education and vocational training institutions for domiciles of the region. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives. 1. Short title and commencement.- (1) This Act may be called the Constitution (Ninety-eighth Amendment) Act, 2012. (2) It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint. 2. Insertion of new Article 371-J.- After Article 371-I of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely- \"371-J. Special provisions with respect to State of Karnataka.- (1) The President may, by order made with respect to the State of Karnataka, provide for any special responsibility of the Governor for- (a) establishment of a separate development board for Hyderabad-Karnataka region with the provision that a report on the working of the board will be placed each year before the State Legislative Assembly; (b) equitable allocation of funds for developmental expenditure over the said region, subject to the requirements of the State as a whole; and (c) equitable opportunities and facilities for the people belonging to the said region, in matters of public employment, education and vocational training, subject to the requirements of the State as a whole. (2) An order made under sub-clause (c) of clause (1) may provide for- (a) reservation of a proportion of seats in educational and vocational training institutions in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region for students who belong to that region by birth or by domicile; and (b) identification of posts or classes of posts under the State Government and in any body or organisation under the control of the State Government in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region and reservation of a proportion of such posts for persons who belong to that region by birth or by domicile and for appointment thereto by direct recruitment or by promotion or in any other manner as may be specified in the order.\". [The Constitution (Ninety-eighth Amendment) Act, 2012, was an important step towards providing a separate administration for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region of the State of Karnataka. Article 371-J provided special provisions for the people of the said region. Provisions were put in place under Article 317-J for reservations of a certain proportion of seats in educational institutions, vocational training institutions, public employment, etc. A separate Development Board was also established to prioritize the progress of the region under this amendment act.

The transfer of Judges from one High Court to another High Court is made by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India under clause (1) of Article 222 of the Constitution. 2. The Supreme Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India, (1998) 7 SCC 739 , had interpreted clause (2) of Article 124 and clause (1) of Article 217 of the Constitution with respect to the meaning of \"consultation\" as \"concurrence\".

After review of the relevant constitutional provisions, the pronouncements of the Supreme Court and consultations with eminent Jurists, it is felt that a broad based National Judicial Appointments Commission should be established for making recommendations for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The said Commission would provide a meaningful role to the judiciary, the executive and eminent persons to present their view points and make the participants accountable, while also introducing transparency in the selection process. 4. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-first Amendment) Bill, 2014 is an enabling constitutional amendment for amending relevant provisions of the Constitution and for setting up a National Judicial Appointments Commission. The proposed Bill seeks to insert new Articles 124-A, 124-B and 124-C after Article 124 of the Constitution. The said Bill also provides for the composition and the functions of the proposed National Judicial Appointments Commission. Further, it provides that Parliament may, by law, regulate the procedure for appointment of Judges and empower the National Judicial Appointments Commission to lay down procedure by regulation for the discharge of its functions, manner of selection of persons for appointment and such other matters as may be considered necessary. 5. The proposed Bill seeks to broad base the method of appointment of Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts, enables participation of judiciary, executive and eminent persons and ensures greater transparency, accountability and objectivity in the appointment of the Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts. 6.

Received the assent of the President on September 8, 2016 and published in the Gazette of India, Extra., Part II, Section 1, dated 8th September, 2016, pp. 1-6, No. 55 Statement of Objects and Reasons.- The Constitution is proposed to be amended to introduce the goods and services tax for conferring concurrent taxing powers on the Union as well as the States including Union territory with Legislature to make laws for levying goods and services tax on every transaction of supply of goods or services or both. The goods and services tax shall replace a number of indirect taxes being levied by the Union and the State Governments and is intended to remove cascading effect of taxes and provide for a common national market for goods and services. The proposed Central and State goods and services tax will be levied on all transactions involving supply of goods and services, except those which are kept out of the purview of the goods and services tax. 2. The proposed Bill, which seeks further to amend the Constitution, inter alia, provides for - (a) subsuming of various Central indirect taxes and levies such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duties, Excise Duty levied under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing Duty, Special Additional Duty of Customs, and Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to the supply of goods and services; (b) subsuming of State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies), Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the States), Octroi and Entry tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury tax, Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling; and State cesses and surcharges in so far as they relate to supply of goods and services; (c) dispensing with the concept of ‘declared goods of special importance’ under the Constitution; (d) levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax on inter-State transactions of goods and services; (e) levy of an additional tax on supply of goods, not exceeding one per cent in the course of inter-State trade or commerce to be collected by the Government of India for a period of two years, and assigned to the States from where the supply originates; (f) conferring concurrent power upon Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws governing goods and services tax; (g) coverage of all goods and services, except alcoholic liquor for human consumption, for the levy of goods and services tax. In case of petroleum and petroleum products, it has been provided that these goods shall not be subject to the levy of Goods and Services Tax till a date notified on the recommendation of the Goods and Services Tax Council; (h) compensation to the States for loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax for a period which may extend to five years; (i) creation of Goods and Services Tax Council to examine issues relating to goods and services tax and make recommendations to the Union and the States on parameters like rates, exemption list and threshold limits. The Council shall function under the Chairmanship of the Union Finance Minister and will have the Union Minister of State in charge of Revenue or Finance as member, along with the Minister in-charge of Finance or Taxation or any other Minister nominated by each State Government.

Illustration In terms of clause (9) of the proposed Article 279-A, the \"weighted votes of the members present and voting\" in favour of a proposal in the Goods and Services Tax Council shall be determined as under:- WT = WC+WS Where, WT=WC+WS=(WST/SP)*SF Wherein- WT = Total weighted votes of all members in favour of a proposal.

[The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, instituted a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India on July 1, 2017. It is the Constitution of India’s One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment Bill. GST is a Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed at the national level to be a comprehensive indirect tax levy on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services. It would replace all indirect taxes levied by the Indian Central and state governments on goods and services. It is intended to be comprehensive for the majority of goods and services. In the past, a person was required to pay a significant amount of taxes, including Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty, State VAT, Entertainment Tax, and Entry Tax. The calculation of tax was significantly simplified with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. The Constitution Amendment Bill 122, often known as the 101 Amendment to the Indian Constitution, advocated for the implementation of GST. To prevent tax escalation and establish a single market for goods and services, the goods and services tax will replace numerous indirect taxes levied by the federal and state governments.

(4) The Commission shall have the power to regulate its own procedure. (5) It shall be the duty of the Commission— (a) to investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the socially and educationally backward classes under this Constitution or under any other law for the time being in force or under any order of the Government and to evaluate the working of such safeguards; (b) to inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of rights and safeguards of the socially and educationally backward classes; (c) to participate and advise on the socio-economic development of the socially and educationally backward classes and to evaluate the progress of their development under the Union and any State; (d) to present to the President, annually and at such other times as the Commission may deem fit, reports upon the working of those safeguards; (e) to make in such reports the recommendations as to the measures that should be taken by the Union or any State for the effective implementation of those safeguards and other measures for the protection, welfare and socio-economic development of the socially and educationally backward classes; and (f) to discharge such other functions in relation to the protection, welfare and development and advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes as the President may, subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, by rule specify.

(9) The Union and every State Government shall consult the Commission on all major policy matters affecting the socially and educationally backward classes.\". 4. Insertion of new article 342 A.

(1) The President may with respect to any State or Union territory, and where it is a State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the socially and educationally backward classes which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be socially and educationally backward classes in relation to that State or Union territory, as the case may be. (2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the Central List of socially and educationally backward classes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) any socially and educationally backward class, but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification.\". 5. Amendment of article 366. In article 366 of the Constitution, after clause (26B), the following clause shall be inserted, namely:— ‘(26C) \"socially and educationally backward classes\" means such backward classes as are so deemed under article 342A for the purposes of this Constitution;’. [The Constitution (One Hundred and Second Amendment) Act, 2018, eliminated states’ authority in the matter to establish socially and educationally backward classes within their borders for the purpose of granting quotas in jobs and admissions in educational institutions. Many deemed some parts of the 102 Amendment of the Indian Constitution as unconstitutional. Then the Parliament made amendments to this act to live up to the values enshrined in the preamble of India. An explanation clause was also added to clarify that all the States and Union Territories of India will have the right to prepare and maintain their lists of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes apart from the Central List. As a matter of fact, we can see that the reason behind Article 102 of the Indian Constitution is to facilitate everyone with equal opportunities irrespective of other societal factors. The concept of majority and minority will hold value in them as the aforementioned Article demands this segregation to be exercised. Also Refer ]'}],\n",

However, some states have chosen to implement the 10% reservation for economically weaker sections. Currently, the quota can be availed by persons with an annual gross household income of up to ₹8 lakh (US$10,000).

In article 342A of the Constitution,— (a) in clause (1), for the words “the socially and educationally backward classes which shall for the purposes of this Constitution”, the words “the socially and educationally backward classes in the Central List which shall for the purposes of the Central Government” shall be substituted; (b) after clause (2), the following shall be inserted, namely:— ‘Explanation.— For the purposes of clauses (1) and (2), the expression “Central List” means the list of socially and educationally backward classes prepared and maintained by and for the Central Government. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in clauses (1) and (2), every State or Union territory may, by law, prepare and maintain, for its own purposes, a list of socially and educationally backward classes, entries in which may be different from the Central List.’. 4. Amendment of article 366. In article 366 of the Constitution, for clause (26C), the following clause shall be substituted, namely:— ‘(26C) “socially and educationally backward classes” means such backward classes as are so deemed under article 342A for the purposes of the Central Government or the State or Union territory, as the case may be.’. [The Constitution (One Hundred and Five Amendment) Act, 2021, restored state governments’ authority to recognize economically and socially disadvantaged groups (SEBCs). A community for which the State in India may give “special provisions” or equality is classified as SEBCs, which contains the categories generally referred to as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The Supreme Court ruled that the separate State lists were exempt from the authority and obligations of the National Commission for Backward Classes. State governments’ ability to create the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) list was reinstated by the 105th Amendment of Indian constitution. It said that States are exempt from the National Commission’s requirement for consultation. Consequently, over one-fifth of all OBC communities benefitted from this. It reinstated a Supreme Court literal interpretation that took away the States’ ability to keep a state list of OBCs. States were granted the power to react swiftly to socioeconomic needs that are unique to a state or region. India already had a federal structure, and the Bill that was passed strengthened it much more. Also refer ]'}],\n",
